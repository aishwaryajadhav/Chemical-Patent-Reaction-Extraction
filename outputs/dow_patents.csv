5,5,"Various moulding processes, such as for example the reaction transfer moulding (RTM) process, comprise the introduction of the reinforcing fibres into a mould, the closing of the mould, the introduction of the crosslinkable resin formulation into the mould and the subsequent crosslinking of the resin, typically by application of heat.

6,6,"One of the limitations of such a process is relative difficulty of laying the reinforcing fibres in the mould. The individual layers of the fabric or non-woven must be cut to size and adapted to a great variety of mould geometries. This can be both time-intensive and also complicated, in particular when the moulding is also intended to contain foam or other cores. Mouldable fibre reinforcements with simple handling and pre-existing reshaping possibilities would be desirable here.

19,19,"Prepregs with a matrix based on 2-component polyurethanes (2-C PUR) are known. The category of the 2-C PUR essentially comprises the standard reactive polyurethane resin systems. In principle, this is a system made up of two separate components. While the critical ingredient of one component is always a polyisocyanate, in the case of the second this is polyols, or with recent developments also amino- or amine-polyol mixtures. The two parts are only mixed together shortly before processing. Thereafter the chemical curing takes place by polyaddition with formation of a network of polyurethane or polyurea. After mixing of the two components, 2-component systems have a limited processing time (stand time, pot life), as the reaction that sets in leads to a gradual viscosity increase and finally to gelling of the system. However, many factors determine the effective duration of its processability: reactivity of the reaction partners, catalysis, concentration, solubility, moisture content, NCO/OH ratio and ambient temperature are the most important [Lackharze, Stoye/Freitag, Hauser-Verlag 1996, pages 210/212]. The disadvantage of the prepregs based on such 2-C PUR systems is that only a short time is available for the processing of the prepreg into a composite. Consequently such prepregs are not stable over several hours, let alone days.

28,28,"Also known are physically drying systems based on non-reactive PUR elastomers. These are high molecular weight, linear, thermoplastic urethanes from diols and diisocyanates, preferably MDI, TDI, HDI and IPDI. Such thermoplastic systems as a rule exhibit very high viscosities and hence also very high processing temperatures. This critically hinders their use for prepregs. In the production of prepregs with fibre composites, the use of powders in reactive systems is more unusual and until now has been limited to a few use fields. Probably the most common process for applying a powder onto a fibre surface is the fluidized bed process (fluidized bed impregnation). By means of an upwardly directed flow, powder particles are converted to a state wherein they exhibit fluid-like properties. This process is used in EP 590 702. In this, the strands of individual fibre bundles are floated apart and coated with the powder in the fluidized bed. The powder here consists of a mixture of reactive and thermoplastic powder, in order thus to optimize the properties of the matrix. Finally, individual rovings (fibre bundles) are laid together and several layers compressed under a pressure of 16 bar for about 20 minutes. The temperatures vary between 250 and 350° C. However, in the fluidized bed process irregular coating often occurs, in particular if the strands are not pulled apart.

29,29,"Concerning this, in US 20040231598 a method is proposed which functions similarly to the fluidized bed process. In this, an air flow transports the particles to the substrate and a uniform deposition of the powder is effected through a specific configuration.

In this, the particle size ranges from 1 to 2000 μm. In several experiments, coating is effected from one or from two sides. Through the uniform application of the powder, laminates with no air inclusions are obtained after subsequent compression of the prepreg.

32,32,"This restriction of the particle size to rather small diameters is also recommended in a study by the Michigan State University.

33,33,"Apart from the prepreg technology, reactive powder systems are also used in other standard processes, for example in winding technology [M. N. Ghasemi Nejhad, K. M.

For the pultrusion process for example fibre strands (towpregs) are coated with the powder and firstly wound and stored as so-called towpregs. One possibility for their production is described in an article in the SAMPE Journal [R. E. Allred, S. P. Wesson, D. A. Babow: powder impregnation studies for high temperature towpregs, Adherent Technologies, SAMPE Journal, Vol. 40, No. 6, pp. 40-48, November/December 2004].

The solvent is then removed. It is preferable that the solvent is completely removed at low temperature, preferably <100° C., via, for example, thermal treatment or application of vacuum. The storable prepregs in turn freed from the solvent can then be further processed at the subsequent juncture to give composites. Through the process according to the invention, a very good impregnation of the fibrous support takes place, due to the fact that the solutions of the reactive polyurethane compositions wet the fibres of the support very well, as a result of which the thermal stress to the polyurethane composition due to prior melt homogenization capable of resulting in an incipient crosslinking reaction is avoided, furthermore the process steps of milling and screening into individual particle size fractions become unnecessary, so that a higher yield of impregnated fibrous support is attained.

Their specific strength and their modulus of elasticity is markedly lower than that of carbon fibres. In combination with the positive coefficient of expansion of the matrix resin, highly dimensionally stable components can be manufactured.

85,85,"Polyisocyanates containing uretdione groups are well known and are for example described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,476,054, 4,912,210, 4,929,724 and EP 417 603. A comprehensive overview of industrially relevant processes for the dimerization of isocyanates to uretdiones is provided by J. Prakt. Chem. 336 (1994) 185-200. In general, the conversion of isocyanates to uretdiones is effected in the presence of soluble dimerization catalysts such as for example dialkylaminopyridines, trialkylphosphines, phosphorous acid triamides or imidazoles. The reaction—optionally performed in solvents, but preferably in the absence of solvents—is stopped by addition of catalyst poisons on attainment of a desired conversion level. Excess monomeric isocyanate is then removed by flash evaporation. If the catalyst is sufficiently volatile, the reaction mixture can be freed from catalyst in the course of the monomer separation. The addition of catalyst poisons can in this case be omitted. Essentially, a broad palette of isocyanates is suitable for the production of polyisocyanates containing uretdione groups. The aforesaid di- and polyisocyanate can be used. However di- and polyisocyanates from any aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or (cyclo)aliphatic di- and/or polyisocyanates are preferred.

Elastomeric compositions and materials may be used to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to the abdominal region. It may be implanted between the abdominal wall and internal organs, for example, by attaching it to the abdominal wall, without cutting internal organs, which would lead to infection. The anti-inflammatory drug can be released from elastomeric compositions and materials over a period of months.

In certain embodiments, an elastomeric composition or material is combined with a harder polymer that plastically forms for the production of stents. Exemplary polymers include any of the polymers known in the art, preferably biodegradable polymers. An elastomeric composition or material may act as a plasticizer that enables the stent to expand into the desired shape after implantation. The stent increases the diameter of the blood vessel to allow easier circulation, but, because the stent is biodegradable, surrounding blood vessels increase in diameter without thrombosis or covering the stent with scar tissue, which would reclose the blood vessel. The time the stent should remain in place and retain its shape before degradation will vary from patient to patient and depend partially on the amount of blockage and the age of the patient (e.g., older patients require more time to heal).

To obtain thin non-porous films, immediately after homogenization, the mixture was spin coated (SCS G3 Spin Coater, Specialty Coating systems, Amherst, N.H.) at 3000 RPM for 3 minutes on glass coverslips. To facilitate ease of release from the underlying substrate, the coverslips surface was pre-modified with a (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane (Gellest, Morrisville, Pa.). Briefly, after the first spin coating, the material was allowed to polymerize for at least 12 hours, followed by spin coating of a second layer directly on the already crosslinked film. The layered structure was confirmed by adding a fluorescent dye (rhodamin B and FITC) to each of the layers prior spin coating, followed by microscope observation. Elastomeric film thickness could be controlled by the consecutive layering of PGSU-SF or by changing the rotation speed during the spin coating procedure. Porous scaffolds were fabricated through a foaming process well known for polyurethane materials, without requiring the use of porogens or blowing agents. Briefly, HDI pre-mixed with Tin(II) (1% v/v) was thoroughly mixed with PGS pre-polymer, followed by casting on a Teflon mold containing grooves (1 cm in diameter and 1 mm in height). The presence of moisture, results in the reaction of HDI with water to form carbon dioxide gas, which diffuses through the elastomeric material and creates pores during the curing procedure.

Aliphatic hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDI) was chosen as the crosslinker given its low cost and wide use in the synthesis of biodegradable and biocompatible polyurethanes. Importantly, PGSU can be synthesized from these components through solvent-based (PGSU-S) and solvent-free (PGSU-SF) methods ( FIG. 6B ). In the solvent-based approach the reaction occurs in an organic solvent, followed by solvent casting. After evaporation, uniform non-porous films with transparent optical properties ( FIG. 1A ) are obtained. To achieve a non-porous elastomer synthesized under solvent-free conditions, after mixing PGS pre-polymer with the crosslinker, the mixture was spin-coated to achieve a uniform film ( FIG. 1B ) with thickness dependent on the spin coating rate. Several stacked layers can be subsequently spin-coated. A strong entanglement between layers is likely achieved due to the reaction of HDI with unreacted hydroxyl groups present in the underlying polymer layer. Porous scaffolds were also fabricated in the absence of organic solvents through a foaming process, well-known for polyurethanes. The presence of moisture results in the reaction of HDI with water to form carbon dioxide gas, which diffuses through the elastomeric material and creates pores during the curing process in thicker films ( FIG. 1C ). The PGS pre-polymer characteristics dictate the properties of the PGSU-SF films obtained: the presence of free hydroxyl groups in the pre-polymer backbone can be easily crosslinked under mild conditions, while the low viscosity at temperatures below 37° C. permits uniform mixing with HDI and spin coating to achieve uniform PGSU layers with controllable thickness. PGSU-SF films can be synthesized in under 24 hours, which is a major advantage compared to other elastomers that require long periods of time for complete polymerization or solvent evaporation.

375,375,"The reaction efficiency and the molecular structure of the derivatives obtained were evaluated by FTIR ( FIG. 6C ). The PGS pre-polymer presents a broad peak at 3445 cm −1 , resulting from free hydroxyl groups (−OH stretch). With the addition of HDI, free hydroxyl groups are replaced by urethane groups and consequently a proportional deviation of this peak to lower wavelength (PGSU-S 1:0.3 at 3359 cm −1 , PGSU-S 1:0.5 at 3337 cm −1 , PGSU-S 1:1 at 3329 cm −1 ) is observed, corresponding to the —NH group stretch. This shift also reveals the increase in hydrogen bonding forces with the isocyanate linker content. The peak near 1735 cm −1 is attributed to the carbonyl group stretching from ester groups in PGS pre-polymer and PGSU derivatives. Amide I and amide II bands at 1630 and 1580 cm −1 are only observed in PGSU derivatives, further confirming the establishment of urethane linkages in the polymer backbone. The absence of the characteristic isocyanate group band at 2270 cm −1 reveals the complete reaction of the isocyanate groups in all PGSU derivatives. Similar spectra were obtained for films prepared through the solvent-free approach, indicating no major chemical differences in the polymeric network established. All derivatives synthesized were insoluble in a variety of organic solvents (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, dioxane, DMF, dichloromethane), further confirming the establishment of an interchain chemically crosslinked network.

(−11.8° C. for PGSU-S 1:0.3, −7.3° C. for PGSU-S 1:0.5, −4.2° C. for PGSU-S 1:1). The material's amorphous nature at room and body temperature assures it elastomeric properties. In addition, the lack of significative swelling of PGSU films in physiological solutions ( FIG. 2 ) also contributes to its mechanical integrity once exposed to a wet environment (e.g. in vivo). The high degree of swelling in ethanol ( FIG. 2 ) facilitates the removal of any unreacted monomers (sol content) entangled in the crosslinked network.

377,377,"Several strategies have been previously reported to improve the mechanical properties of PGS elastomers, including the addition of micron-size fillers (e.g. Bioglass), or the introduction of novel functional groups (e.g. amide groups) to improve the polymer crosslinking. Despite considerable improvements in the range of properties achieved, high curing temperatures are still required. Through simply changing the degree of crosslinking introduces by the urethane groups, PGSU films can be tailored to achieve a broad range of mechanical properties (Young's modulus from 0.1 to 20 MPa, approximately), mimicking the stiffness of a diverse range of tissues, such as the myocardium, pericardium, skin, aorta, or cartilage ( FIGS. 6C and D). Also of interest is the improved tensile strength of PGSU films compared to thermally cured PGS. For example, both PGSU-S and —SF 1:0.3 and PGS show a Young's modulus bellow 1 MPa but, the urethane crosslink improves the tensile strength (1.35±0.76 MPa for PGSU-S 1:0.3, 0.38±0.06 MPa for PGS) and elongation (516±109% for PGSU-S 1:0.3, 200±30% for PGS) properties of the material. These features may be exploited in load-bearing applications where strength and elasticity are essential. Furthermore, biomaterials are often significantly manipulated prior to proper placement and thus must maintain their integrity not only following transplantation but also during surgical implantation. Towards this end, PGSU also shows a favorable behavior when exposed to continuous cyclical loadings, presenting minimal creep deformation and minimal loss of tensile strength after 100 tensile cycles ( FIG. 6F ). The presence of covalent crosslinks between the polymeric chains likely prevents them from sliding past one another, therefore improving their stability under dynamic environments. In comparison, aliphatic polyurethanes have been associated with permanent deformation once exposed to tensile forces.

378,378,"To determine the potential of PGSU derivatives in biomedical applications, we assessed their biodegradation profiles and cytocompatibility in vitro. In the presence of cholesterol esterase, PGSU-S films exhibited a degradation profile dependent on the degree of crosslinking ( FIG. 3 ). The ester groups in the polymer backbone are highly sensitive to enzymatic degradation; however, with increased urethane content the accessibility to ester bonds is hindered resulting in slower degradation rates. Human mesenchymal stem cells were used to test the cytocompatibility of PGSU-S materials. Cells adhered to PGSU-S films at lower extent than tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) (day 1); however, they were able to proliferate and at day 8 their metabolism, as assessed by a MTT assay, was not statistical different in both culture conditions ( FIG. 4 ). Given the positive preliminary data, we examined the in vivo acute and chronic inflammatory response in a subcutaneous rat animal model and compared with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), an FDA-approved material for several internal applications. PLGA samples were only visible during harvesting at 1 week, as all samples were nearly fully degraded at 4 week post-implantation. No adverse reactions to the implants or complications were noted during the implantation period. H&E and anti-CD68 macrophage stainings were employed to characterize the inflammatory response to the implantes ( FIG. 7A ). The inflammatory responses to the PGSU-S was similar when comparing all derivatives, and characterized as mixed lymphohistiocytic reaction with predominance of histiocytic at 1 and 4 week time points and lymphocytic reaction at all later time points. No giant cells could be identified in any material group at any time point. All PGSU sample groups exhibited mild to moderate infiltration by CD68-positive macrophages at 1 wk post implantation; at all later time points, CD68-positive infiltration was characterized as mostly minimal. The inflammatory reaction to PLGA was significantly higher (p<0.5) at 1 and 4 weeks than the reaction to the PGSU-S ( FIG. 7B ). Capsule thickness did not vary significantly among all samples ( FIG. 7B ), and was considerably thinner when comparing with other previously described elastomers.

At week 40 , explanted PGSU-S 1:0.3 and PGSU-S 1:0.5 samples were broken and therefore not considered for weight loss evaluation. The degradation rate observed for all the derivatives is slower than what has been described for other elastomers, such as PGS whose degradation rate cannot be tuned. SEM evaluation of PGSU-S 1:0.3 following 20 weeks showed minimal morphological changes on the micron-scale suggesting that the degradation mechanism is based on surface erosion ( FIG. 6D ). No significant weight loss or morphologic changes were observed for PGSU-S 1:1 samples during the 40 week study.

380,380,"One of the areas where biodegradable elastomers are gaining much attention is cardiac therapy, with potential applications ranging from reconstructive procedures, tissue engineering to localized drug delivery. Previous studies demonstrated that the mechanical compliance and degradation properties of biomaterials applied to the heart strongly influence cardiac function and the material's integration with the host tissue. However, clinically-used materials (e.g., Dacron) are stiff, non-degradable and are associated with long-term fibrosis and calcification, compromising regional function. Porous PGSU-SF 1:0.3 exhibits similar mechanical properties to native heart tissue and, given the mild synthetic conditions, may allow localized delivery of bioactive macromolecules. Such an approach may provide new therapeutic options for cardiac disease given that many biomolecules exhibit short half-lives and/or present systemic toxicity. Towards potential cardiac applications, we performed a preliminary in vivo biocompatibility study to evaluate how porous PGSU-SF 1:0.3 interacts with myocardial tissue. Specifically, PGSU-SF films could be easily manipulated and sutured, showing excellent tear-resistant properties. Cardiac acute and chronic inflammatory responses to PGSU-S 1:0.3 films were evaluated one and four week after surgery, respectively, through H&E staining ( FIG. 6E ). While diffuse granulation tissue and infiltrated lymphocytes were visible surrounding the implant, the myocardial surface did not show signs of a significant inflammatory response and no major fibrotic response or collagen deposition was observed. No changes in cardiac function were observed via echocardiography analysis ( FIG. 6F ). Moderate chest adhesions, common following thoracotomy procedures, were observed during heart excision at both time points.

381,381,"Given the possibility of preparing PGSU-SF elastomers under mild conditions, we evaluated its applicability as a controlled delivery system of bioactive molecules. While the use of polyurethane foams for the delivery of therapeutic proteins has been previously reported, the mechanical properties of the materials obtained have been limited to tensile moduli bellow 0.12 MPa. In contrast, proteins could easily be loaded directly into the highly tunable PGSU-SF, without interfering with the curing process or final properties of the elastomer. To evaluate the bioactivity of the released biomolecules, lysozyme was used as a model protein, given the availability of simple and cost-effective assays to quantify its activity. The protein was encapsulated in porous PGSU-SF and exhibited a small burst during the first 48 hours, followed by sustained protein release for at least 5 days (data not shown). Importantly, the majority of the protein released was bioactive ( FIG. 8A ).

382,382,"Next, to achieve tighter control over the delivery profile, we developed a strategy based on the sequential layering of PGSU-SF, allowing fine control over the localization of the encapsulated molecules ( FIG. 8B ). When the pre-polymer is spin coated at 3000 RPM and without protein powder, the size of each layer is 33.5±0.1 μm. Given that the release is based on diffusion and polymer degradation mechanisms, controlled release could be achieved through altering the stacking order of protein-loaded and unloaded layers, the size of the encapsulated protein powder, and the presence of osmotic agents. As proof of concept, the lyophilized model protein Bovine Serum Protein (BSA) was sieved to particle sizes bellow 32 μm, similar to the thickness of each layer, and 75 μm. These were encapsulated in internal layers of PGSU-SF 1:0.3 films. Given the low swelling in aqueous solution of PGSU films, the majority of the protein is entrapped in the polymeric network, especially when the particle size is smaller than the layer thickness ( FIG. 8C ). The use of particles of bigger size results in increased protein release at earlier time points given the proximity to the polymer surface. This might promote a porous structure that further contributes the sustained release of protein for longer periods of time. The release efficiency could be improved through the co-encapsulation of BSA with an osmotic agent, trehalose, by improving the water uptake from PGSU-SF films ( FIG. 5 ). The encapsulation of BSA-trehalose sieved to small particle size in internal PGSU-SF layers resulted with sustained protein release for more than 18 days, with almost 50% of the total loading released ( FIG. 8D ). The encapsulation of the same formulation in external polymer layers results in faster release of the protein loaded. These preliminary results demonstrate the versatility of PGSU-SF materials, which can be selectively modulated to achieve highly specific release kinetics through simple changes in the films preparation methods.

",0,US10040223-20180807.txt,0
415,415,"Flexible polyurethane foam is commonly produced by methods of molding and free-rise. The process of molding polyurethane flexible foam involves introducing chemicals required for making foam, such as one or more polyols, one or more isocyanates and one or more additives, in the desired ratio by injection or open pour into an individual, multiple or continuous mold and allowing the reacting foam system to fill the mold(s).

416,416,"Molded flexible polyurethane foam articles such as pillows, automotive seating, or head rests are made in various molds that have a mold release applied to the inside surfaces of the mold prior to injecting or pouring foam-forming chemicals into the mold. The mold release mixtures are typically sprayed to promote even coverage. However, there are other methods of application such as wiping, pouring, and any other method which deposits a thin film or a film thick enough to provide the desired mold release properties on a surface.

417,417,"A mold can be defined as a hollow form or matrix that gives a particular shape to an article in a molten or plastic state. It can be constructed from a metallic or nonmetallic material and its shape can be simple or complex, depending on the nature of the molded part. Before the mold is used, it may be necessary to pretreat the mold surface, thereby improving the adhesion of the mold release mixture. This can be accomplished through various means such as sandblasting or disc sanding, sand paper polishing, degreasing, or electropolishing.

418,418,"Conventional mold release compositions comprise materials such as waxes or silicones, which are dissolved or dispersed in a solvent carrier, which may be organic solvent-based, petroleum-based or water-based. Petroleum-based mold release compositions usually have a problem with imparting an odor to the foam surface. In order to remove petroleum or solvent odors from a molded foam part, it needs to be exposed to sufficient airflow to allow the odorous solvent(s) to volatilize or diffuse away from the foam surface prior to packaging. Water-based mold release compositions typically do not have the odor problems that solvent-based mold release compositions have.

419,419,"Molded foams may have a problem with skin delamination, wherein the skin splits from the main body of the foam, if the mold is opened before the skin has sufficiently cured. In order to reduce skin delamination, the foamed part may have to stay in the mold for a longer time and at a higher temperature to crosslink or cure the skin.

429,429,"It has been discovered that producing and using a mold release mixture comprised of a barrier release coating and a curing catalyst improves surface curing, increases skin porosity, reduces skin delamination on the mold surface, and/or reduces de-molding time of molded polyurethane foams when the mold release mixture is applied to the mold prior to addition of any polyurethane foam reactants.

",0,US10040223-20180807.txt,0
431,431,"Polyurethane foam reactants are mixed together usually with a high shear mixer or high shear mix head, and poured in a mold. After adding the required weight of polyurethane reactants, the mold is closed and the foam is allowed to react and expand. The skin curing rate is affected by the temperature of the mold. Cooler mold temperatures tend to reduce the blowing efficiency of the foam reactants and reduce the volume of the foam cells, thereby increasing the skin foam density. Alternatively, higher mold temperatures can reduce the skin density.

432,432,"The barrier release coating portion of the mold release mixture is comprised of film-forming lubricating oils, solid lubricants, waxes, other lipids, silicones or fluids whose purpose is the prevention of sticking or adherence to the surface upon which they are coated by any polyurethane foam reactants. Barrier release coatings may be in the range of about 0.1 independently to about 99.9% by weight in the mold release mixture, alternatively from about 50 independently to about 98 wt %, before application to the mold surface and may occur in a non-limiting embodiment as liquids, semisolids, or solids at ambient room temperature. It should be understood that the use of the term “independently” in conjunction with a range means that any lower threshold may be joined with any upper threshold to form an acceptable alternate range.

434,434,"General categories of lipids include, but are not limited to, waxes, oils, and fats. Each of these can be subdivided by the source from which they are derived, with the generalized sources being organic and mineral origins, the former of which can be further subdivided into animal and plant origins. In general, fats and oils are predominantly, but not necessarily, triesters (triglycerides, triacylglycerols or TAGs) of glycerol and aliphatic fatty acids containing up to 22 carbon atoms, differing in large part by the level of unsaturation of their fatty acids, a property directly related to their melting point. Waxes are esters of long-chain fatty acids, usually, but not necessarily, containing between 24 and 28 carbons atoms, with long-chain primary alcohols comprising between 16 and 36 carbon atoms or with alcohols of the steroid group.

435,435,"Fatty acids are defined as carboxylic acids consisting of a hydrocarbon chain and a terminal carboxyl group, especially any of those occurring as esters in fats and oils. The fatty acids that comprise lipids can be subdivided by their level of saturation, thought of generally as the relative number of single bonds to double bonds occurring between adjacent carbon atoms, where a higher relative level of single bonds means the fatty acid is more saturated. The level of saturation can be determined either qualitatively or quantitatively by one of a few known methods. Qualitative analysis of a compound can be done via either the bromine test, where the sample is treated with elemental bromine, or Baeyer's reagent, comprised of a strong oxidant, potassium permanganate. In both cases, the unknown sample is treated with the appropriate reagent and reaction with double or triple bonds leads to a change in color whose hue and saturation give a qualitative notion of that compound's level of unsaturation. Quantitative analysis can be determined either by analyzing the nature and structure of the compound via NMR spectroscopy and/or IR, or more commonly via determination of the Iodine Value (IV). Defined as the mass of iodine in grams that is consumed by 100 grams of a chemical substance, this value is based on the tendency of double bonds to react with iodine compounds, and as such, the higher the iodine number, the higher the presence of double bonded carbons, and thus the higher the level of unsaturation. For a fatty acid, IV is determined by AOCS Method Tg 1a-64, and for fats and oils, it is found with AOCS Method Cd 1-25.

Alpha-olefins can be further subdivided into branched and linear based upon the specific arrangement of the carbon molecules.

If such a calculation is not possible or is impractical, the HLB of a system can be determined experimentally via invert emulsion experiments, gas-liquid chromatography, or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Frequently, emulsifiers represent a blend, where the resultant HLB of the system is calculated as the weighted average of the HLBs of the individual components. For a water and oil system, the required HLB can be calculated experimentally, and the relative values of the HLB of the emulsifier system will determine the type and thickness of solution desired in the final product. For example, an emulsifier system with an excessively low HLB can be used as a thickener. In the case of mold release, which is applied through a spray, the solution should be of a fairly low viscosity, so the HLB of the emulsification system should be targeted to be at least as hydrophilic as the required HLB of the system (HLB emulsification ≥HLB required ). Once the appropriate HLB for the system has been determined, it is important to find an emulsification system with the ideal chemical type for ideal emulsification. This, too, can be determined experimentally. The emulsifier blend can be adjusted to suit this requirement while tuning the HLB. The percentage of each emulsifier required to have a blend of emulsifiers A and B with the desired HLB, X, can be calculated with the following equations:

484,484,"When surfactants are used in a solution, the point known as the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is the concentration of surfactant past which all additional surfactant will interact with itself to form micelles. By definition, surfactants are molecules that contain a region that is lipophilic (the “tail”, containing an abundance of carbon and hydrogen and is attractive to oils) and another that is hydrophilic (the “head”, which is generally polar and is attractive to water). When the CMC is reached, these molecules interact with one another, aligning their corresponding lipophilic and hydrophilic portions with those of adjacent surfactants to produce a structure that can have a variety of shapes, the most common of which is a sphere where the hydrophilic heads reside on the outside and the lipophilic tails are collected on the inside (see FIGS. 4 and 5 ). Known as a micelle, these surfactants no longer contribute to surface tension or aid in the emulsion of insoluble components of a mixture. The value of this CMC is affected by the presence of various salts, ions, and other components, and was a factor that was carefully considered in the selection of the emulsifier and determination of the optimal mixture for the mold release solutions addressed in the composition and methods described herein.

579,579,"Table 1 gives a summary of the data used to generate FIG. 6-11 . From FIG. 6 , it can be seen that, at any of the three temperatures tested, there is less residue of foam remaining on the mold surface when the mold release mixture is used, as compared to the same surface with the standard release coating, when each mold release is added at similar quantities. Here, it is shown that the mold release mixture maintains a consistently low level of delamination across all three temperatures, which the standard release coating only approaches at the highest temperature. It does so asymptotically, indicating that this may be a baseline level of delamination achieved by either mold release across all tested conditions. FIG. 8 highlights the difference in foam delamination on each plate onto which the mold release mixture and standard release coating have been sprayed, respectively, at the lower of the three temperatures (135° F. (57° C.)) for various quantities of mold release applied. This indicates that the improvement in demolding is consistent across a range of application amounts in this temperature range. FIGS. 8 and 9 show the effect of the mold release mixture and standard release coating on the airflow of the skin of foams by comparing the percent loss in airflow from that of samples taken from the bottom, middle, and top of each foam, as well as the average of these three values. FIG. 8 compares foams poured onto plates at 155° F. (68° C.) that have been coated with mold release mixture and standard release coating, respectively, while FIG. 9 shows the same comparison for plates at 175° F. (97° C.). These temperatures are highlighted in preference of the lower temperature, because in the latter case, delamination was significant enough with the standard release coating that the lack of surface skin skewed the results. In both figures, it can be observed that mold release mixture shows significantly lower loss in airflow, indicating that the release coating is improving the surface airflow over that achieved with standard release coatings. FIGS. 10 and 11 show the rate and degree to which the two mold releases dry on the surface of the mold at various temperatures. These times are comparable, showing that the addition of catalyst would not have a negative impact on processing and drying times during production.

580,580,"Table 2 gives a summary of the results of Example 3, which were used to generate FIGS. 12-15 . From FIGS. 12 and 13 , it can be seen that the choice in amine catalyst has an impact on the ability of the foam to demold from the plate, evinced by the amount of foam residue remaining on the plate. All of the catalysts used in FIG. 12 had 2% by weight of each of the catalysts used, while those in FIG. 13 had 20% by weight of each catalyst used. A comparison of the results from these two values shows a clear improvement in demolding ability of the foam as the % weight of any individual catalyst is increased as well. FIGS. 14 and 15 compare the amount of foam residue remaining on the plate after the application of each mold release mixture with the foam residue remaining after the application of the standard mold release, measured as % change. Here, the higher the value, the greater improvement in demolding ability that was shown with the addition of catalyst. In all cases, it can be seen that the addition of the catalysts used at both levels shows a clear advantage in demolding ability of the foam, with certain catalysts clearly performing better than others at the same levels. Again, by comparing the results of these two values, it can be seen that increasing the quantity of catalyst shows an improvement in demolding ability of the foam. In the cases of FIGS. 14 and 15 , it should be noted that RC6 was not included, as the mixture proved impossible to spray, so no meaningful results could be determined.

This is desirable since a pressure increase occurs in vacuum panels over the course of time. A further intention was that the porous materials also have advantageous thermal conductivities in the aerated condition, i.e. at atmospheric pressure.

826,826,"Rigid foams, e.g., polyurethane and/or polyisocyanurate foams are used in various industries such as appliance manufacturing and construction. Rigid foams may have thermal insulation properties, fire resistance properties, and/or structural properties within specified density ranges. As discussed in US Patent Publication No. 2004/0256594, historically cholorofluorocarbon (CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) based blowing agents have been used to produce rigid foams; however, due to environmental concerns alternatives are sought. The use of hydrohaloolefin based blowing agents has been proposed, but as discussed in International Publication No. WO 2009/048807, there are concerns with respect to storage stability of the formulated isocyanate-reactive blends when polyols, amine based catalysts, and olefins are included therein. In particular, when a foam is produced by reacting an isocyanate component with a formulated isocyanate-reactive blend, instability in the formulated blend could lead to lower quality foams or foam failure.
",0,US10125235-20181113.txt,0
827,827,"For example, as discussed in International Publication No. WO 2009/048807, the instability may be based on the reaction of certain amine catalysts with the hydrohaloolefin based blowing agents, which essentially may inactivate the amine catalyst. It is proposed in International Publication No. WO 2009/048807 to use specific sterically hindered amine based catalysts in place of customarily used amine catalysts; however, this is a restrictive option that may increase the overall cost (e.g., cost of components and/or manufacturing costs) associated with producing the rigid foam and/or may not be commercially viable. Accordingly, alternatives to using sterically hindered amine catalyst to form storage stable formulated isocyanate-reactive blends that include at least a polyol component, an amine catalyst, and an olefin (e.g., hydrohaloolefin) based blowing agent, are sought.

830,830,"DETAILED DESCRIPTION
",0,US10125235-20181113.txt,0
831,831,"Polyurethane polymers (e.g., that are used to form polyurethane based products such as rigid foams, flexible foams, viscoelastic foams, elastomers, etc.) contain urethane moieties and are made by starting materials that include an isocyanate component and an isocyanate-reactive component. The isocyanate component includes one or more polyisocyanates, one or more isocyanate-terminated prepolymer derived from one or more polyisocyanates, and/or one or more quasi-prepolymers derived from one or more polyisocyanates, as would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art. The isocyanate-reactive component includes a polyol component (e.g., that includes one or more polyols), a catalyst component (e.g., that includes one or more amine catalysts), and a blowing agent component (e.g., that includes one or more olefin based blowing agents and/or a hydrohaloolefin). A reaction mixture for forming the polyurethane polymers may optionally include water, e.g., as an additive or as part of the blowing agent component (e.g., the water may be added as part of the isocyanate-reactive component). The reaction mixture for forming the polyurethane polymers may include an optional additive component that includes one or more optional additives (e.g., a curative agent, a chain extender, a filler, a stabilizer, a surfactant, and/or other additives that modify properties of the resultant final product). The optional additive component may be separate (e.g., separately provided) from the isocyanate component and the isocyanate-reactive component.
",0,US10125235-20181113.txt,0
832,832,"The isocyanate-reactive component may be entirely or in part pre-blended before mixing with the isocyanate component (i.e., may be mixed before reacting with the isocyanate component). In embodiments, at least the polyol component, the catalyst component, and the blowing agent component are pre-blended, e.g., for ease of manufacturing. As such, compatibility with the isocyanate-reactive component is important, e.g., compatibility between the polyol component and the catalyst component, compatibility between the polyol component and the blowing agent component, and/or compatibility between the catalyst component and the blowing agent component.
",0,US10125235-20181113.txt,0
833,833,"For example, compatibility between the catalyst component and the blowing agent component and/or the polyol component may have an effect on the resultant polyurethane products. By way of an example, since catalyst assisted polymerization occurs when forming a final polyurethane product (such as a rigid foam), if the catalyst is not able to assist in polymerization, the polymerization may not be complete and/or may take too long so as not to be commercially feasible. An incomplete polymerization may produce a low molecular weight polymer and/or leave unreacted isocyanate groups, which may lead to crosslinking by thermally induced reactions and/or reaction with water (or bubble formation leading to defects in an elastomer, adhesive, sealant, etc.). A slow polymerization may lead to a process that is commercially infeasible and/or an inferior product. Accordingly, embodiments relate to the use of a storage stable isocyanate-reactive component that allows for improved compatibility within the starting materials.

834,834,"For example, by storage stable isocyanate-reactive component it is meant the isocyanate-reactive component is storable at least at one of room temperature and a higher temperature for a period of at least 1 day with a less than 10 second change in gel time when reacted with an isocyanate component at an isocyanate index from 100 to 150, compared to when the same isocyanate-reactive component is stored for a period of less than 1 day at room temperature and reacted with the same isocyanate component at the same isocyanate index from 100 to 150. In other words, by storage stable it is meant that there is a less than 10 second change in gel time when a same isocyanate-reactive component before any such storage is reacted with a same isocyanate component at a same isocyanate index within the range of 100 to 150.

835,835,"For example, by storage stable isocyanate-reactive component it may be meant that the component is be storable at room temperature and/or a higher temperature (such as from 35° C. to 80° C., from 35° C. to 60° C., from 39° C. to 51° C., from 40° C. to 50° C., at 40° C., at 50° C., etc.) for a period of at least 10 days (e.g., from 1 day to 10 days, from 1 day to 14 days, from 1 day to 49 days, from 1 days to 50 days, from 1 days to 100 days, etc.) without a substantial change (i.e., less than 10 seconds) in gel time when the storage stable isocyanate-reactive component is reacted with an isocyanate component (e.g., at room temperature of 21±2° C.) to form a polyurethane product. According to exemplary embodiments, the storage stable isocyanate-reactive component is storable at room temperature, a higher temperature of 40° C., and/or a higher temperature of 50° C. for a period of at least 10 days with no more than 6 seconds in gel time when reacted with the isocyanate component at room temperature. For example, the isocyanate-reactive component is storable at 50° C. for a period of from 1 day to 14 days with a less than 6 second change in gel time when reacted with the isocyanate component at the isocyanate index from 100 to 150, compared to when the same isocyanate-reactive component is stored for the period of less than 1 day at room temperature and reacted with the same isocyanate component at the same isocyanate index from 100 to 150.

Referring to Examples 9 and 10, it is seen that when the EO content is derived from only polyether polyols (i.e., no polyester polyols are used) storage stability, when storage at 50° C., may be reduced compared to when polyether polyols are combined with polyester polyols (as a source of EO content). Further, it is seen that with increased amounts of the aromatic amine initiated polyether polyol, decreased storage stability, when storage at 50° C., may be realized.

920,920,"A method for making joints in an electrical cable is disclosed. A first cable having polymeric insulation and a first bare conductor end and a second cable having polymeric insulation and a second bare conductor end are provided and joined create a conductor joint. A curable reaction mixture is applied over the conductor joint and cured to form a polymeric insulating sheath over the conductor joint and bonded to the polymeric insulation of each of the first and second cables. The reaction mixture includes a carbon-Michael acceptor compound, a carbon-Michael donor compound and a carbon-Michael reaction catalyst.

",0,US10150834-20181211.txt,0
922,922,"When electrical cables are joined, it is necessary to repair the electrical insulation around the joint. One common way of accomplishing this is to encapsulate the joint in an organic resin. The molded resin forms a sheath around the joint and bonds to the polymeric electrical insulation of the cables. This forms a continuous seal that not only provides electrical insulation, but also protects against the intrusion of humidity and liquids such as water.
",0,US10150834-20181211.txt,0
923,923,"The organic resin needs to meet several criteria. When cured, it must adhere well to the cable insulation. The bond between the cured resin and the cable insulation needs to be impervious to liquids and moisture and have good hydrolytic stability. The bond needs to be long-lasting, as the joined cable may be in operation for many years in locations where it is not easily accessible for repair. The cured resin also must be a good electrical insulator. The cured resin must be resistant to breakdown in the presence of an electrical field produced by the current passing through the cable.
",0,US10150834-20181211.txt,0
924,924,"Processing characteristics are also important attributes for the curable organic resin. Cable splicing is frequently performed in the field, i.e., at the point of use of the cable. In addition, the amount of organic resin needed to make a particular splice is sometimes quite small, on the order of a kilogram or less, although in some cases these amounts can be quite substantial, up to 30 liters or more in volume. These considerations dictate that the curable polymer system be capable of application using simple methods. Complex polymer processing equipment usually is not available in these in-field locations, and in any event often is not adapted very well for managing small volumes of material. Another consideration due to in-field application is that heating equipment is usually not available. This means that the curable organic resin must be capable of application and curing at whatever temperature may be present at the application site, without additional applied heating.
",0,US10150834-20181211.txt,0
925,925,"The curable organic resins systems used in these cable joining applications typically include two liquid components that are mixed, applied to the cable joint and then cured to form a sheath about the joint. The liquid components should be low to moderate in viscosity so they can be mixed and applied easily. The mixed components need to have a pot life of several minutes or more to allow time to complete the mixing and the application of the mixture onto the joint. After the reaction mixture is applied to the joint, it should cure reasonably quickly to form a polymer that bonds strongly to the cable insulation.

926,926,"To date, two-component polyurethane and two-component epoxy resins systems have mainly been used for this application. The polyurethane systems work very satisfactorily, but there are potential worker exposure concerns if polyisocyanate compounds are not handled properly. In addition, polyisocyanates can react with water to produce carbon dioxide, which can lead to foaming. This can be a serious problem in in-field applications, as the material is often exposed to water or humidity as it cures. Exposure even to atmospheric moisture alone is often sufficient to cause foaming, which leads to a loss of electrical insulation properties, and also can form pores in the material though which water and other fluids can penetrate.
",0,US10150834-20181211.txt,0
927,927,"Epoxy resin systems suffer from two main problems. First, they tend to be too rigid and brittle to be entirely satisfactory. A second problem is that the curing reaction tends to be highly exothermic. The released heat of reaction causes a large temperature increase. In many cases, the temperature increase is enough to damage the cable. That damage leads to defects in the insulation.

928,928,"Therefore, it would be desirable to provide an isocyanate-free curable resin system for joining cables, which has a good pot life, which cures at room temperature or even somewhat lower temperatures, without the application of additional heat, which is not highly exothermic, and which cures to form a polymer having low electrical permittivity, resists breakdown in the presence of an electrical field, and which forms a good bond to the polymeric insulation used in electric cables.

934,934,"The electrical cables to be joined in accordance with the invention include one or more conductors (wires) and a polymeric electrical insulation surrounding the conductors. Typically the conductors are individually insulated, and in the case of a multiwire cable, the individually-insulated wires are typically sheathed in another polymeric insulator. The polymeric insulator may be, for example, neoprene, polyethylene, ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene rubber, a chlorosulfonated polyethylene, another type of polyolefin, polyvinylchloride, a nitrile rubber such as a polymer or copolymer of acrylonitrile, a diene rubber such as a polymer or copolymer of butadiene, a polyurethane, and the like. The conductors are typically metals such as copper, aluminum and steel. The conductor size range may be, for example, from AWG (American Wire Gauge) 40 (about 0.0799 mm diameter) to 4/0 (about 11.684 mm diameter).

If multiwire cables are to be joined, then each of the conductors of each of the cables is joined in similar manner. Electrical tape or other insulation is optionally applied over the individual splices. Similarly, if more than two cables are to be joined, the conductors of all the cables are joined as necessary for the particular wiring protocol, including, if necessary, applying electrical tape or other insulation over the individual splices. Then a curable reaction mixture is applied over the conductor joint and in contact with the polymeric insulation of the first cable and the second cable.

936,936,"It is often convenient to perform the applying and curing steps in a mold, by which it is meant any device that holds the reaction mixture in place until it cures. A mold may be a one-piece or two-piece type adapted to fit over a cable conductor joint. A typical mold is designed at its ends to fit tightly around the cables when the mold is closed. Alternatively, the ends of the mold can be blocked off using tape or other means to prevent the reaction mixture from leaking out before it cures. Such a mold typically has a larger cross-section central region that forms a reservoir encompassing the cable joint, and has an opening for introducing the curable reaction mixture into the reservoir. An example of such a mold is that marketed by 3M United Kingdom PLC in its Scotchcast™ Flexible Power Cable Jointing Kits, 82-F and 82-BF series. In certain embodiments, the mold is positioned over the cable joint and the curable reaction mixture is poured into and cured in the mold.

It is not necessary to apply additional heat to the reaction mixture, although that can be done if a rapid cure is wanted. It is preferred to form the reaction mixture at a temperature of 0 to 35° C., especially 10 to 30° C., and to allow the reactants to cure without additional applied heat.

",0,US10155837-20181218.txt,0
994,994,"Flexible polyurethane foams are tailored to meet the needs of particular markets. When good load bearing properties are needed, the polyols may include a polymeric component, such as a styrene-acrylonitrile polymer polyol dispersed in a base polyether polyol. When high reactivity is needed, as in the production of molded foams, “reactive polyols” having a high content of primary hydroxyl groups are used. Still other polyols are used at low NCO/OH index to produce viscoelastic (or “memory”) foam. In general, however, the polyols used to make these flexible foams are polyether-based materials derived from petroleum.
",0,US10155837-20181218.txt,0
995,995,"Aromatic polyester polyols are commonly used to produce rigid polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams, but relatively few sources recommend using such polyols to produce flexible polyurethane foams. Rigid foams normally require polyols with average hydroxyl functionalities greater than about 2.5 and relatively high hydroxyl numbers that range from 200-300 mg KOH/g. Usually, the aromatic polyester polyols are made by polycondensation of diacids or anhydrides with diols, although in some cases, polyethylene terephthalate has been proposed as a suitable reactant. Some references also suggest incorporation of natural oils or other hydrophobes into the aromatic polyester polyols for the purpose of improving compatibility with the hydrocarbon blowing agents used to produce rigid foams. For examples of such aromatic polyester polyols, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,608,432; 5,877,255; 5,922,779; and 6,664,363.
",0,US10155837-20181218.txt,0
996,996,"Currently, only a minor fraction of polyols used to produce flexible polyurethane foam comes from biorenewable resources or recycled materials. Recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and other thermoplastics provide a low-cost, potentially valuable feedstock for making polyols for flexible foams while decreasing our reliance on petrochemical-based polyether polyols.

Such polyols should have sufficiently high average hydroxyl functionality (i.e., from about 2.5 to 3.0) and hydroxyl numbers in the useful range of about 20 to 150 mg KOH/g.

A minor proportion of organic or inorganic foreign matter (e.g., paper, other plastics, glass, metal, etc.) can be present. A desirable source of rPET is “flake” rPET, from which many of the common impurities present in scrap PET bottles have been removed in advance. Another desirable source of rPET is pelletized rPET, which is made by melting and extruding rPET through metal filtration mesh to further remove particulate impurities. Because PET plastic bottles are currently manufactured in much greater quantity than any recycling efforts can match, scrap PET will continue to be available in abundance.

",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1108,1108,"A variety of different polyurethanes are typically prepared by the polymerization of diisocyanates, for example 4,4′-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate), MDI for short, or tolylene 2,4-diisocyanate, TDI for short, with polyether polyols or polyester polyols. Polyether polyols can be produced, for example, by alkoxylation of polyhydroxy-functional starters. Commonly used starters are, for example, glycols, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol or sucrose. In the production of polyurethane foams, one of the most important polyurethane systems, additional blowing agents are typically used, examples being pentane, methylene chloride, acetone or carbon dioxide. Water is usually used as chemical blowing agent, which reacts with isocyanate to give polyurea with elimination of carbon dioxide. Typically, the polyurethane foam is stabilized using surface-active substances, especially silicone surfactants.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1109,1109,"Polyurethane foams have outstanding mechanical and physical properties and so are used in a very wide variety of fields. The automotive and furniture industries are a particularly important market for various PUR foams (=polyurethane foams), such as conventional flexible foams based on ether and ester polyols, cold-cure foams (frequently also referred to as HR foams), rigid foams, integral foams and microcellular foams and also foams with properties between these classifications, for example semi-rigid systems.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1110,1110,"A specific class of polyurethane foams is that of viscoelastic foams. These are also known by the “memory foam” name and are notable both for a low rebound resilience (preferably <10%, whereas the rebound resilience of conventional flexible PUR foams is 35%-45%) and for a slow, gradual recovery after compression (recovery time preferably 2-10 seconds). Materials of this kind are well known in the prior art and are highly valued for their energy- and sound-absorbing properties. Viscoelastic foam materials are encountered in a multitude of fields of use for cushioning (for example, in cushions, seat covers, mattresses, etc.), as sound- and/or vibration-deadening materials, or as impact protection. Typical viscoelastic foams have lower porosity and high density compared to standard flexible ether polyurethane foams. Cushions having a density of usually 30-50 kg/m 3 are at the lower end of the density scale typical of viscoelastic foams, whereas mattresses often have a density in the range of 60-130 kg/m 3 .
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1111,1111,"Among the viscoelastic foam materials, those made from polyurethanes are of the greatest significance. This is firstly because it is possible, through the choice of the polyol and isocyanate components and of any further auxiliaries used, to very precisely adjust the physical properties of the resultant polyurethane foam, and secondly also because it is possible, through “in situ” production (optionally on site), to produce foam materials of virtually any shape and structure, including very complex shapes and structures.

1112,1112,"The majority of the conventional polyurethane foams are block copolymers which have spatially separate regions of different phases having high and low glass transition temperatures (TG). The glass transition temperature divides the brittle energy-elastic region (=glass region) below it from the soft entropy-elastic region above it (=elastomeric region). These high and low glass transition temperatures of different phases within the polymer normally define the temperature range within which the material can be used. The DMA (“dynamic mechanical analysis”) spectra of such materials typically feature a relatively flat region (“modulus plateau”) between the different glass transitions.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1113,1113,"The phase of low glass transition temperature in these materials typically (but not always) derives from a “block” of low glass transition temperature, which is preformed and only then subjected to the polymerization. The phase of high glass transition temperature, in contrast, does not normally form until during the polymerization, as a result of the concurrent formation of urethane units. The block of low glass transition temperature (often also referred to as “soft block”) typically derives from a liquid or from an oligomeric resin of low melting temperature, which contains a multitude of groups reactive toward isocyanate units. Polyether polyols and polyester polyols are examples of such oligomeric resins.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1114,1114,"In conventional polyurethanes, the hard phases (high glass transition temperature) and soft phases (low glass transition temperature) become arranged with respect to one another during the polymerization and then separate spontaneously from one another in order to form morphologically different phases within the “bulk polymer”. Such materials are also referred to correspondingly as “phase-separated” materials. In this context, viscoelastic polyurethanes are a special case where the above-described phase separation occurs only incompletely, if at all. The glass transition temperature of viscoelastic foams is preferably between −20 and +15° C., but the glass transition temperature of standard flexible polyurethane foams is regularly below −35° C.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1115,1115,"Such “structural viscoelasticity” in the case of polyurethane foams having (predominantly) open cells should be distinguished from viscoelasticity attributable to a pneumatic effect. This is because, in the latter case, virtually closed cells are present within the foam material, i.e., only slightly opened cells. As a result of the small size of the orifices, the air flows back in only gradually after compression, which results in slowed recovery. Examples of such viscoelastic foams based on a pneumatic effect are the commercially available products Cosypur® and Elastoflex® from BASF Polyurethanes GmbH.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1116,1116,"In general, viscoelastic polyurethane foams are more difficult to produce on a commercial scale than conventional flexible PUR foams. The foaming itself and the curing of the resultant foam are very sensitive to disturbances. Small variations in the composition (for example in the event of variations in the catalyst loading) or in the process regime can lead quickly to reject material. The amount of water in the case of production of viscoelastic PUR foams having typically less than 3 pphp (parts per hundred parts polyol) is smaller than in the case of conventional flexible PUR foams. This fact, in combination with the use of specific polyols, makes it much more difficult to produce viscoelastic PUR foams.

1117,1117,"In formulations for production of viscoelastic PUR foams, relative to the amount of water molecules, there are far more polyol hydroxyl groups available for a reaction with isocyanate groups than in formulations for production of conventional flexible PUR foams. The increased competition between polyol and water molecules slows the blowing reaction and hence the formation of CO 2 . This also results in slowing of the chain extension based on the formation of urea segments. The resulting changes in the blowing and gel reactions frequently lead to unstable structures in the foam or to collapses.

1118,1118,"There have already been many descriptions in the prior art of processes for synthesis of polyurethane foams having structural viscoelasticity, these usually having the common feature of the use of a specific polyol composition, in addition to an isocyanate component, which can be chosen more or less freely. Thus, the viscoelastic properties which result from a rise in the glass transition temperature to room temperature are frequently obtained through a combination of various measures during the foaming process. Usually, this specific polyol mixture consists of various polyols. Often, plasticizers are also used.

1119,1119,"As well as the above-described problems in the production of viscoelastic PUR foams, it is common knowledge that the cell opening is a particularly critical step in the production of such foams. Particularly when TDI T80 is used as isocyanate component, there is frequently severe shrinkage as a result of insufficient cell opening, which in turn makes it more difficult to run the process.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1120,1120,"Furthermore, there is a general trend toward higher foam densities. This is achieved through the use of MDI/TDI mixtures or the use of MDI as the sole isocyanate source. However, higher densities entail a lower water content and hence a lower proportion of chemical blowing agent in the foam formulation. The reduction in the water level results in a smaller amount of urea formed, which in turn results in a foam having lower porosity. In order to compensate for this level of closed cells, large amounts of cell opener are often used in such formulations (for example often more than 3 parts per hundred parts polyol (pphp)). However, large amounts of cell openers frequently have adverse effects on the cell structure and mechanical properties (tensile strength, compression set, expansion, etc.) of the foam.

1121,1121,"The polyalkylene oxide cell openers described in WO 2007/146351 are very effective even in small use amounts and are usable in various foam densities and formulations (TDI, MDI or mixtures thereof), but the amount of silicone stabilizer has to be increased considerably for a fine cell structure.

1122,1122,"Various further means are known in the prior art for opening of closed cells in flexible polyurethane foams.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1123,1123,"For instance, it is possible to open the cells in flexible polyurethane foams by a mechanical route, by flexing the corresponding mouldings after demoulding. This method is commonplace, but is both time-consuming and energy-intensive and is employable only in the production of mouldings.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1124,1124,"In addition, the open-cell content of viscoelastic polyurethane foams can be improved by using, as compounds having at least two hydrogen atoms reactive with isocyanate groups, mixtures of at least one polyether alcohol having a high content of ethylene oxide, preferably at least 50% by weight, and at least one polyether alcohol which is incompatible with these polyether alcohols and has a high content of propylene oxide, preferably at least 90% by weight. Thus, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0254256 describes viscoelastic foams produced with a polyol component containing 30 to 70 parts by weight of a polyether alcohol having a high proportion of ethylene oxide units in the polyether chain. EP 1 240 228 describes the production of viscoelastic foams using polyether alcohols having an ethylene oxide content in the polyether chain of at least 50% by weight and a hydroxyl number in the range between 40 and 50 mg KOH/g. The use of the ethylene oxide-rich polyether alcohols does increase the open-cell content of the foams, but a disadvantage of the use of polyether alcohols having a high proportion of ethylene oxide in the chain is the increase in the hydrophilicity of the foams. As a result, these foams swell up to 40% by volume on contact with water. This swelling behaviour is unacceptable particularly for applications in moist environments.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1125,1125,"Cell openers used in the prior art are still various kinds of additives. For instance, solid particles are frequently used for opening of polyurethane foams. For example, CaCO 3 is a standard filler in the PU industry. However, the cell-opening properties of calcium carbonate are usually too low for viscoelastic applications. Very large amounts are required and, even when 15 pphp are used, the result is frequently nevertheless shrinkage of the viscoelastic PUR foams. These high use amounts then additionally lead to an altered cell structure and altered mechanical properties.
",0,US10189965-20190129.txt,0
1126,1126,"A standard method for opening the cells of water-blown polyurethane foams is the use of incompatible liquids, called defoamers. The incompatible liquids, i.e., defoamers, are immiscible with the polyol/isocyanate reaction mixture, but can influence the silicone stabilizers in the reaction mixture at the phase interface and thus facilitate cell opening. Typically, dimethylsiloxanes (silicone oils) are used for this purpose. A known problem with the use of silicone oils is that they promote cell opening at a very early stage of foam formation and hence destabilize the foam. A further disadvantage of the use of silicone oils as cell openers is the very narrow processing window and the usually very coarse cell structure of the resultant foams. In addition, it is also possible to use mineral oils as incompatible liquids. Although these are effective cell openers, mineral oils lead to an oily surface and hence to an unwanted tactile perception of the foams. However, there are also incompatible liquids which are indeed possible cell openers. A problem frequently encountered with incompatible liquids used as cell openers is the unpleasant odour and poor emission characteristics, for example determined in accordance with the test chamber method based on the DIN standard DIN EN ISO 16000-9:2008-04, 24 hours after test chamber loading, as elucidated in detail in the examples section among other places.

1127,1127,"A further approach is the use of linear block copolymers consisting of polydimethylsiloxane blocks and polyether blocks [(polyether)(polydimethylsiloxane)] n , as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,836,560 and DE 10 2006 061 351 A1. These (AB) n structures (i.e., copolymers) are capable of stabilizing the foam in the formation phase by preventing the coalescence of the gas bubbles. At the end of the foam-forming reaction, the (AB) n structures then facilitate cell opening. Below 30 000 g/mol, the (AB) n copolymers have a minor stabilizing effect, and for that reason the minimum average molar mass is typically 30 000 g/mol, preferably between 65 000 g/mol and 100 000 g/mol. However, a problem is that these copolymer structures have a tendency to form hydrogels in the presence of water, which restricts the field of use thereof to a very high degree. A second problem with such (AB) n structures is that the control of the molecular weight during production is not trivial, which leads to a complex process regime. Furthermore, such structures are usually highly viscous because of their high molecular weight, which can lead to difficulties in handling on the part of the processor conducting foaming operations.

In the context of the present application, polyols are especially understood to mean compounds having at least two hydrogen atoms reactive toward isocyanate groups, i.e. especially diols, triols, etc. Preferably, at least one polyol having a relatively high OH number (>100 mg KOH/g) is used in the production. The effect of such a polyol is that the density at network node points is increased and hence the glass transition temperature is raised. The glass transition temperature in the case of inventive viscoelastic foams is preferably between −20 and +15° C. The glass transition temperature of standard flexible polyurethane foams, in contrast, is regularly below −35° C. The mean glass transition temperature can be measured by means of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) (DIN 53513:1990-03) or by means of differential calorimetry (DSC) (ISO 11357-2:2013). Strictly speaking, it is a glass transition range which extends over a temperature range. As a result of the high glass transition temperature of the viscoelastic flexible foams, some network segments are still frozen, and of restricted mobility, in the polyurethane network at room temperature.

On the outside, a PUR foam insulation of thickness 5 cm prevented excessively rapid cooling. On the inside, the box was lined with a plastic film in order to subsequently be able to remove the cured foam. After being poured in, the foam rose up in the foaming box. In the ideal case, the foam blew off on attainment of the maximum rise height and then fell back slightly. At this time, the cell membranes of the foam bubbles opened, and an open-pore cell structure of the foam was obtained. In the case that foam stabilization was too small, the PUR foam collapsed before attaining the maximum rise height. In the case that stabilization was too great, the foam rose for a very long period and did not blow off. As a result of the cell structure being very closed in that case, the foam shrank in the course of subsequent cooling as a result of the contraction in volume of the cooling gas.

1345,1345,"The interest in utilization of lignin in various applications has steadily grown over the years with the main driving force to find a sustainable alternative to mineral oil-based products. An area where the intrinsic properties of lignin i.e. the existence of a cross-linked network, can be harnessed most efficiently is the utilization of lignin to reinforce a multitude of polymeric materials such as urethane-based networks and polymers.

[12], Li et al. [13], Xue et al. [14], and Arshanitsa et al. [15, 16] alkoxylation of lignin has been attempted. However, these approaches so far encounter some serious drawbacks; 1) All scientific publications as well as all relevant patents report significant degrees of homopolymerization of propylene oxide under the reaction conditions applied [WO 2013,113,462]. As a consequence, the degree of process control for the polyol synthesis is severely reduced and the formulation latitude is more or less lost due to difficulties to assess how much homopolymer is formed.
",0,US10196478-20190205.txt,0
1347,1347,"2) At the reported reaction conditions, self-condensation of the lignin macromolecule structure is always present leaving non-soluble fractions in the resulting polyol [WO 2013,113,462]. This requires additional filtration step(s) in the polyol manufacturing process.

By setting the integral area of the backbone carbons at 70 ppm to 14 (assuming 7 repeating methylene units in the PEG400 backbone), the integral area of the group peaks at 18 ppm is obtained. This peak is distinctive for the methyl group of the propylene oxide. Presence of this group indicates either that homopolymers are formed or that propylene oxide capping of terminal hydroxyls of the dispersing polyol has occurred. Assuming a full propylene oxide capping of the dispersant polyol, this integral area is expected to have value of 2 (one methyl group per hydroxyl group of PEG400). Dividing this integral area with 6 yields the percentage of dispersant capped by propylene oxide. The obtained value was 6.5%.

The fully developed foam was then probed by a disposable (wooden) spatula to check the formation of strings in the foaming mass. The first appearance of these strings was recorded as ‘string time’. Finally, the same spatula was used to test ‘tackiness’ of the fully risen foam. The first disappearance of tackiness was recorded as ‘tack free’ time. Polyurethane (PUR) foams were selected as the first target to demonstrate the capabilities of the invention which is however not limited to this particular application.

1504,1504,"Viscoelastic foam, also known as memory foam, is characterized by its slow recovery after compression and low resiliency. Resilience is an indicator of the surface elasticity or “springiness”. It is measured by dropping a standard steel ball onto the cushion from a given height and measuring the ball rebound percentage. Low resilience viscoelastic foam typically has a ball rebound percentage of less than 20% as compared to 50% to 60% for other flexible polyurethane foam. In addition, viscoelastic foam is able to dampen vibration and absorb shock. Viscoelastic foam allows pressure redistribution by conforming to the shape of the weighted object applying force to it. These properties are desirable in bedding materials, vehicle seating applications, cushioning sports equipment and footwear, ergonomic applications and shock absorbing application.

1505,1505,"Polyurethane foams are commonly produced by reacting petroleum-derived polyol and polyisocyanate. However, the recent interest in environment friendly and sustainable products has led to the development and utilization of natural oil-based polyol that are suitable to replace petroleum-based polyol in polyurethane foams manufacturing.

1506,1506,"Introduction of natural oil-based polyol into formulations of viscoelastic foam can affect the foam's resilience and hysteresis properties. Furthermore, formulating and processing range of viscoelastic foams are more restrictive than conventional flexible polyurethane foams. The biggest limitations in using natural oil-based polyol to produce viscoelastic foams is to obtain open cell structure in the foam and avoid shrinkage at high level of foam softness. WO2008063594 relates to a viscoelastic polyurethane foams produced by reacting a polyisocyanate, and a mixture of oligomeric natural oil-based polyol and a petroleum-based derived polyol. However, it is worth mentioning that not all natural oil-based polyol can be used together with petroleum polyol in producing viscoelastic foams.

1594,1594,"Catalysts are used to control the relative rates of water-isocyanate (gas-forming) and polyol-isocyanate (gelling) reactions. The catalyst may be a single component, or in most cases a mixture of two or more compounds. Heretofore, preferred catalysts for polyurethane foam production were organotin salts and tertiary amines. The amine catalysts are known to have a greater effect on the water-isocyanate reaction, whereas the organotin catalysts are known to have a greater effect on the polyol-isocyanate reaction. Total catalyst levels generally vary from 0 to 5.0 parts by weight per 100 parts polyol. The amount of catalyst used depends upon the formulation employed and the type of catalyst selected. Control of the gelling catalyst level is critical to producing foams with desired air permeability, which is a factor known to significantly affect foam cushioning performance. However, metallic catalysts, such as organotin catalysts, are toxic to health. Thus, one objective is to produce flexible polyurethane foams with desired air permeability and other foam properties without using metallic catalysts, or at least limiting the amount of metallic catalysts in the foaming mixture. And, gelling and blowing catalysts have been known to produce polyurethane foams with significant levels of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.

The amount of isocyanate employed is frequently expressed by the term “index” which refers to the actual amount of isocyanate required for reaction with all of the active hydrogen-containing compounds present in the reaction mixture multiplied by 100. For most foam applications, the isocyanate index is in the range from 75 to 140. In this invention, the preferred isocyanate index is in the range of 80 to 95, more preferably about 90.

2002,2002,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,US10246548-20190402.txt,0
2003,2003,"Polymer materials are classically subdivided in two main classes, thermosets and thermoplastics, according to their thermal behavior. The first synthetic thermosets for practical applications were invented in 1907 by Leo Baekeland by the combination of formaldehyde and phenol. The resulting highly cross-linked network gave a rigid material that does not soften when heated, and due to its versatility it was also called “the material of a thousand uses” (D. Crespy, M. Bozonnet, M. Meier, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2008, 47, 3322). Today, thermosets are used for many demanding applications because of their dimensional stability, creep resistance, chemical resistance and stiffness. Because of their molecular architecture, thermosets cannot be reshaped, processed or recycled after full curing. In contrast, thermoplastics can flow upon heating enabling multiple and easy processing, such as extrusion (N. G. Gaylord, J. R. Van Wazer, Journal of Polymer Science 1961, 51, S77), as well as recycling in many cases (M. Biron, Thermoplastics and Thermoplastic Composites: Technical Information for Plastics Users , Elsevier Science, 2007). Designing polymer systems which would combine the benefits of traditional thermosets with the ‘plastic’ properties that facilitate processing is therefore a challenge that has recently attracted great interest.
",0,US10246548-20190402.txt,0
2004,2004,"A way to make the combination of these properties is offered by the introduction of exchangeable chemical bonds into a polymer network, leading to dynamic cross-links. These bonds should be able to rearrange themselves in a reversible manner, providing on a molecular level a mechanism for macroscopic flow without risking structural damage. Polymer networks containing such exchangeable bonds, also known as covalent adaptable networks or CAN's (a) C. J. Kloxin et al., Macromolecules 2010, 43, 2643; b) C. N. Bowman, C. J. Kloxin, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 4272; c) C. J. Kloxin, C. N. Bowman, Chem. Soc. Rev. 2013, 42), may be further classified into two groups: those relying on dissociative exchange reactions and those relying on associative exchange reactions (a) T. F. Scott, et al., Science 2005, 308, 1615; b) R. Nicolaÿ et al., Macromolecules 2010, 43, 4355; c) Y. Amamoto, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 1660).
",0,US10246548-20190402.txt,0
2005,2005,"The most common ‘dissociative’ group of CAN's relies on a simple reversible covalent bond formation between two groups attached to the polymer chains. By triggering the reversed bond forming step (bond dissociation) the material can achieve topology rearrangements (stress relaxation and flow) simply because of a decrease in connectivity during the temporary depolymerization, resulting in a strong and sudden viscosity drop. Such systems will always present a sol/gel transition and can thus be solubilized in the presence of solvent. A well-known example of a thermally triggered dissociative CAN relies on the well-known reversible Diels-Alder reaction between furans and maleimides (X. Chen, Science 2002, 295, 1698).
",0,US10246548-20190402.txt,0
2006,2006,"A less common type of CAN's makes use of associative bond exchanges between polymer chains, in which the cross-links between polymer chains are only broken once another bond to another (part of the) polymer chain has been formed. As a result, such systems can change their topology with no loss of connectivity during the dynamic reorganization process, making such networks effectively permanent and insoluble even at (very) high temperatures. Interestingly, as with all chemical reactions, the rate of this associative exchange increases with the temperature, leading to an Arrhenius-like viscosity dependence rather than a sudden and marked viscosity drop at the sol/gel transition. Thermally triggered associative CANs have been coined vitrimers, (M. Capelot et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 7664.) because of their unique combination of insolubility and gradual thermal viscosity behavior which makes these permanent polymer networks processable just like glass.

2007,2007,"In 2011, Leibler and co-workers introduced and demonstrated the unique properties of vitrimer materials using simple transesterification chemistry in an epoxy-based resin, cross-linked with polycarboxylic acids. Addition of a mild Lewis acid catalyst like zinc acetate to these classical resins resulted in an insoluble material which combined great mechanical properties, like classical hard epoxy resins, with the ability to be reshaped and reprocessed after full curing (D. Montarnal et al., Science 2011, 334, 965; b) M. Capelot et al., ACS Macro Letters 2012, 1, 789).
",0,US10246548-20190402.txt,0
2008,2008,"Since then, several other systems have been explored as possible vitrimer materials. Altuna and co-workers were able to produce citric acid-based polyester networks capable of some stress-relaxation even in the absence of a catalyst (internally catalyzed by unreacted carboxylic acids) (F. I. Altuna, V. Pettarin, R. Williams, Green Chemistry 2013).

2009,2009,"Other polyester network and catalyst combinations have also been explored. (J. P. Brutman et al., ACS Macro Letters 2014, 607). Vitrimer(-like) materials have also been reported based on olefin or disulphide methathesis reactions (Y.-X. Lu, Z. Guan, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 14226; Y.-X. Lu, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 8424; A. Rekondo, et al., Materials Horizons 2013; Z. Q. Lei, et al., Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 2038).

These relaxation times range from 550 s at 130° C. to 85 s at 170° C. Taking into account the absence of catalyst and the rather rigid polymer structure, no other permanently cross-linked systems or vitrimers exhibit such a fast relaxation. This characteristic likely reflects the very high density of vinylogous urethanes in the network and the low activation energy for exchange (vide supra). Since the relaxation times are controlled by the associative exchange reactions, the temperature dependence of the relaxation time can be described by the Arrhenius equation [L. H.

3075,3075,"In accordance with stress-relaxation experiments, creep experiments also confirmed that the vinylogous urethane polymer according to the invention behaves like a viscoelastic liquid at elevated temperatures. FIG. 10 depicts the results of elongational creep experiments at different temperatures. Following the initial elastic response, primary creep with a rapid rate decrease was observed. Then, a steady state was reached, characterized by a constant creep rate. When the stress was released, the material recovered only its initial elastic response and a permanent deformation remained. The networks were easily deformed up to 45% without rupture over a broad temperature range. These results clearly show that the vinylogous urethane polymers according to the invention can be processed without a precise control of the temperature, in strong contrast to the strict conditions required for processing of thermoplastics.

3077,3077,"The recyclable nature of the networks was examined by first grinding the samples into fine particles which were used as raw substance for compression molding ( FIG. 11 ). To ensure the reversibility, the procedure was repeated four times and the recycled samples were subjected to tensile tests, DMA, DSC, solubility experiments, and ATR-FTIR for characterization. Tensile testing was performed on a Tinus-Olsen H10KT tensile tester equipped with a 100 N load cell, using flat dog bone type specimen with an effective gage length of 13 mm, a width of 2 mm, and a thickness of 1.3 mm. The samples were cut out using a Ray-Ran dog bone cutter. The tensile tests were run at a speed of 10 mm/min. Tensile tests revealed that the mechanical properties of the sample were fully recovered after being remoulded for 30 minutes at 150° C. ( FIG. 6 ). No change was observed in the Young's modulus and stress at break ( FIG. 12 ) while the strain at break ranged between 5.5 and 7.5% independently of the recycling cycle. In addition, DMA confirmed the recovery of the mechanical properties, as the observed rubbery plateau was constant within the experimental error (±5%), which indicates that no cross-links were formed nor broken ( FIG. 13 ). Since a slight shift in the maximum value of tan δ was observed, DSC was performed, and showed that the glass transition (Tg) at the second heating changed by less than 1° C. ( FIG. 14 ). In further agreement with DMA, solubility experiments showed that the soluble fraction varied from 7 to 14% without following a clear trend (Table 2), with the soluble fraction of the polymer as originally prepared being almost identical to that of the material recycled four times.

Stress-relaxation and creep experiments showed a viscoelastic liquid behavior. Due to the fast exchange reactions and high density of exchangeable bonds throughout the network, relaxation times as short as 85 s at 170° C. were achieved without the use of any catalyst. These compositions could be recycled by grinding and remoulding the material several times without loss of mechanical properties. The compositions and material and articles made therefrom can be reworked to any shape while being at the same time permanently cross-linked.

3243,3243,"The present invention discloses a flexible laminate structure suitable for forming a packaging container having a built-in opening and reclose feature 1 , the laminate comprising a two-part structure, namely an outer structure 8 joined in face-to-face relation with an inner structure 9 . The adjectives “inner” and “outer” are related to the position in the packaging container, the inner structure 9 being in contact with the content of the packaging container and the outer structure 8 being in contact with the environment. Inner and outer structures can also be named first and second structures of the laminate.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3244,3244,"In general, the inner and outer structure are joined by means of adhesives, wherein the adhesive strength of the adhesive used for the reclosable built-in opening is different from the adhesive strength of the adhesive used for the remainder of the flexible laminate structure.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3245,3245,"In prior art, the concept of “differential adhesion strength” on various substrates is always expressed as a binary terminology, referring to a “permanent adhesive” and a “pressure-sensitive adhesive”.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3246,3246,"In general, a pressure-sensitive adhesived structure is defined as a separable structure without breaking or rupturing any layer when peeling the structure. A permanent adhesived structure on the other hand, is not separable without breaking or rupturing any layer when peeling the structure.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3247,3247,"Yet, the terminology “Pressure-sensitive adhesive” is jargon, commonly used and accepted in the industrial world, which actually is erroneous since all adhesives are pressure sensitive. The terminology that would have to be used in order to designate the so-called “pressure-sensitive adhesives” is “permanent tacky adhesives” since the latter adequately and properly expresses their characteristics. Such a permanently tacky adhesive can be used for repeatedly de-attaching and attaching different substrates such as an inner and an outer structure of a flexible laminate structure.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3248,3248,"Likewise, the terminology “permanent adhesive” cannot be considered as an absolute concept; whether an adhesive is permanent or not will depend on various factors such as type of substrate, application method, temperature and ageing among others.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3249,3249,"Because the expressions “permanent adhesives” and “pressure-sensitive adhesives” are not totally representative for the real life situations and because transition states between both may exist the present invention uses the terminology “first adhesive” and “second adhesive” wherein the bond/peel strength of the second adhesive is higher than the bond/peel strength of the first adhesive.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3250,3250,"Within the context of the present invention, the term “first adhesive” stands for an adhesive with a first bond/peel strength and which is permanently tacky, while the term “second adhesive” stands for an adhesive with a second bond/peel strength, wherein the first bond/peel strength is lower than the second bond/peel strength, the difference between both being at least 0.5 N/15 mm measured according to a T-peel geometry at a speed of 100 mm/min and room temperature. and wherein both, the first adhesive and the second adhesive are obtained from the conversion of the same adhesive precursor by subjecting said common adhesive precursor to differential actinic irradiation.
",0,US10259632-20190416.txt,0
3251,3251,"The peel strength tests were inspired by ISO 11339, using a T-peel geometry, at room temperature. The tests were performed using an Instron™ tensile machine with a cross-head speed of 100 mm/min. The width of the tested strips was 15 mm, and the results are reported in N/15 mm. The sample is cut perpendicular to the extrusion direction.

3252,3252,"With permanent tacky, the present invention means that the bond/peel strength after five consecutive de-attaching/attaching cycles does not decrease by more than 75%, preferable by not more than 60%, more preferably by not more than 50% or even not more than 40% of its initial value. It is obvious that the bond/peel strength values obtained in such tests is, for one type of first adhesive, dependent of the time interval between each de-attaching/attaching cycle, the pressure applied for re-attaching the flap, temperature at which the test is performed, the size of the marginal region 10 and the thickness of the first adhesive in the first adhesive region, among others. In the present invention the flexible laminate is stored at room temperature for the whole test and the test is repeated in intervals of one hour. The pressure for re-attaching the flap is exerted by pushing the thumb and forefinger against each other.

3253,3253,"Although the rupture of facing layers largely depends on their tear strength, it is generally admitted, within the context of the present invention that the bond/peel strength obtained by the first permanently tacky adhesive should be lower than 1.3 N/15 mm, preferably lower than 1.1 N/15 mm, more preferably lower than 0.9 N/15 mm to avoid rupturing the facing layer.

3254,3254,"The second adhesive cannot be used for opening and reclose features. The bond/peel strength obtained by the second adhesive should be higher than 1.50 N/15 mm, preferably higher than 1.6 N/15 mm, more preferably higher than 1.8 N/15 mm and can be as high as 3.0 N/15 mm where the peel force represents in fact the tear strength of one of the layers.

3851,3851,"Recently, a polyurea paint containing polyamine and polyisocyanate has been used widely for fast reactivity, and mechanical property, chemical resistance in a cured product, and the like. Particularly, the polyurea paint using as a polyamine polyaspartic acid ester has attracted a lot of attention in the viewpoint of appropriate curable rate, and the possibility of making the coating more thick (for example, Non Patent Document 1). Therefore, the used amount of the polyurea paint has been increased in a market. In addition, a polyurea resin obtained from a polyaspartic acid ester has attracted a lot of attention in the application other than paint in the viewpoint of good mechanical property. However, a cured product (polyurea resin) obtained from a polyaspartic acid ester has problems such as fragile and easy cracking properties. On the other hand, effective means of lowering fragile property, that is, improving toughness without greatly affecting on other property (for example, appearance) has not been found in the present state.

The drying can be performed by any suitable technique including, but not limited to, use of a conventional oven and other heating techniques known in the art. Alternatively, the composition can be sprayed onto the desired substrate and allowed to dry. The visco-elastic polymer film layer that results on the substrate may be tacky or non-tacky depending on the hybrid composition and the domain arrangement. The visco-elastic polymer film may be a pressure sensitive adhesive or a non-tacky film former.

4430,4430,"In many of the applications described in the present invention, including tapes, labels and transdermal drug delivery systems, it is often necessary to use a backing layer and a release layer. The backing layer can be any of the typical substrates used for tapes such as those selected from polymeric films (e.g. polyethylene, polyester, polyimide, polyolefins, polypropylene, polyurethane, PTFE, etc.), metal foils, glass cloth, PTFE-coated glass cloth, paper (e.g. crepe, super-calendared craft, etc.), cloth, nonwoven materials, foams (e.g. polyurethane, acrylate, silicone, neoprene, etc.) and rubbers (e.g. silicone, butyl, etc.). Release liners are generally supplied on a backing such as paper or film and are applied to the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic composition after the drying and/or curing steps are complete. Three general types of release coatings the are suitable for use with both silicone-based PSAs and acrylate-based PSAs, and also with the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic compositions of the present invention are known in the art and are commercially available: silicone-based release liners (e.g. Dow Corning® Syl-Off™ 7680, Dow Corning Corp., Midland Mich.), perfluoropolyether-based release liners (e.g. 3M SCOTCH-PAK® 1022 Release Liner) and fluorosilicone-based release liners (e.g. Dow Corning® Syl-Off™ Q2-7785). The release liner for a particular application will be dependent upon the domain arrangement of the final multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic composition after removal of the second solvent to form the visco-elastic polymer film. If the silicone phase is external a fluorinated release liner is preferred while a silicone-based release liner may be preferred if the acrylate phase is external.

4431,4431,"These adhesives (the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic compositions) are also particularly suited for other electronic monitoring and medical device attachment applications that require adhering medical devices to the skin or body. Other end uses that this material may be especially suited for include film formers for the protection and/or delivery of active agents to skin, nail, hair or other biological tissues. Film formers are those visco-elastic materials that when applied to biological substrates such as skin, teeth, mucosa or plants form a thin, flexible continuous, semi-continuous or discontinuous layer of the viscoelastic material that adheres to the biological substrate and performs a desired function. Typical functions for films include delivery of active agents to the surface of the biological surface, to an intermediate layer of the biological surface or completely through the biological surface. Alternatively, the films may be used to protect the skin from external stimuli, including pollution, moisture or chemicals. Alternatively, the materials of this invention can be used as components of semisolid drug delivery compositions where they can impart thickening, substantivity, and other benefits to the formulations.

The transdermal drug delivery system includes an active agent and the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic compositions of the present invention functioning as a pressure sensitive adhesive. The active agent and its relationship to the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic composition in the context of the transdermal drug delivery system are described in detail below. As those skilled in the art appreciate, the transdermal drug delivery system is structural and can be in many forms including, but not limited to, patches, films, multi-layer dressings, reservoir systems, and combinations thereof. The active agent is in the transdermal drug delivery system for controlled transdermal delivery to a substrate. It is also possible, but not required, for the transdermal drug delivery system to include a backing layer for supporting the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic composition, and/or a release liner for protecting the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic composition and/or the active agent prior to the controlled transdermal delivery of the active agent to the substrate.

4435,4435,"The amount of the active agent incorporated into the transdermal drug delivery system varies depending on many factors including, but not limited to, the particular active agent, the desired therapeutic effect, and the time span for which the system is to provide therapy. For most active agents, the passage of the active agent through the skin is the rate-limiting step in transdermal delivery. Thus, the amount of the active agent and the rate of release are typically selected so as to provide transdermal delivery characterized by a zero order time dependency for a prolonged period of time. The minimum amount of active agent in the transdermal drug delivery system is selected based on the amount of active agent which passes through the skin, or other substrate, in the time span for which the system is to provide therapy. Preferably, the amount of active agent in the transdermal drug delivery system varies from about 0.1% up to about 60% by weight of the system, more preferably from about 0.3% up to about 50% by weight of the system, and for the lower drug doses permitted by this invention, most preferably from about 1.0% up to about 30% by weight of the system. The weight of the transdermal drug delivery system is, at a minimum, the combined weight of the active agent and the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic composition. Examples of active agents for use in the transdermal drug delivery systems described herein can include, but are not limited to, hypertensives, like ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, steroids, including corticosteroids and other natural and synthetic steroids, hormones, including androgens and estrogens and progestragens, anti-fungals including imidazoles and thioazole anti-fungals, antihelmintics for example benzimidazoles, pain relievers such as opiates and steroids, stimulants such as methylphenidate, and other topically and transdermally-administered active agents.

These other agents are also referred to in the art as skin-penetration or permeation enhancers, accelerants, adjuvants, and sorption promoters, and are collectively referred herein simply as “enhancers”. These enhancers includes those with diverse mechanisms of action including those which have the function of improving the solubility and diffusibility of the active agent within the multi-phase silicone acrylic hybrid visco-elastic composition and those which improve percutaneous absorption, for example, by changing the ability of the stratum corneum to retain moisture, softening the skin, improving the skin's permeability, acting as penetration assistants or hair-follicle openers or changing the state of the skin including the boundary layer. Some of these enhancers have more than one mechanism of action, but in essence they serve to enhance the delivery of the active agent to the substrate.

Hansen solubility parameters were determined to be a good predictor of additional solvents and, therefore, allow the utility of other solvents beyond the ones used in the majority of the experiments. The measured solubility was performed on a “low tack” hybrid with a 50:50 EHA:MA ratio and dried from ethyl acetate (PSA 3, acrylate phase external), a “low tack” hybrid with a 50:50 EHA:MA ratio and dried from heptane (PSA 4, silicone phase external) and a “high tack” hybrid with a 60:40 EHA:MA ratio and dried from heptane (PSA 6, silicone phase external). This was performed by placing the hybrid solids in a jar along with an equal amount of solvent by weight and placing on a mixing wheel. These studies indicate that by controlling the phase arrangement through solvent selection, the solubility of the material can be manipulated and is primarily influenced by the external phase; for example, Table 11 indicates that heptane is a good solvent for silicone and a poor solvent for acrylate (65:35 EHA:MA) and the data in Table 12 confirms that when the silicone phase is external (as in PSA 4) the solubility in heptane is enhanced.

This rate was adjusted during the polymerization process in order to control the kinetics and exothermic effects of the reaction. Sample was taken for analysis and as the conversion of monomer reached 41%, EBiB (1.75 mL) was injected. Then the acetone solution of V-70 was fed at 5 mL/h rate. As the monomer conversion reached 82%, the flask was opened to air. The cross-linking of arms was continued in the same flask with the molar ratio of reagents as: [((MMA) 20 -co-(SMA) 7 )-b-(tBA) 461 ]/[(tBA) 82 ] arms/DVB/CuBr 2 /TPMA/Sn(EH) 2 =1/20/0.012/0.072/0.14 in anisole. A solution of CuBr 2 /TPMA (36.2 mg CuBr 2 /330 mg TPMA) in DMF (13.2 mL), DVB (39.4 mL), and anisole (600 mL), were added to the reactor, and the resulting polymer solution was purged with N 2 for 1 h. The reactor was then heated up to 95° C., and Sn(EH) 2 (1.05 mL) was injected, the reaction started. Sample was taken for analysis and 19 hours later as the conversion of DVB reached 82%, the heating was stopped and the reactor was opened to air. Molecular weight of [((MMA) 20 -co-(SMA) 7 )-b-(tBA) 461 ]/[(tBA) 82 ] star molecule was determined by GPC. Mn=94705 g/mol, Mp=254651 g/mol, PDI=2.87. The deprotection was then conducted by adding formic acid (150 mL) and sulfuric acid (0.3 mL) to the reactor. The reaction mixture was heated up to 75° C. After 6 hours, the reaction was finished. The liquid was decanted and the solid polymer was washed with acetonitrile and acetone in the reactor for 3 times. The solid polymer was recovered from the flask and dried in vacuum oven at 40° C. for 1 day. Yield: the mass of [((MMA) 20 -co-(SMA) 7 )-b-(AA) 461 ]/[(AA) 82 ] star was 175 gram.

The water was stirred at 600 rpm to generate vortex, and to this was slowly sprinkled in a certain amount of the specified solid polymer. The resulting aqueous polymer solution was then heated to 30° C., and if necessary, adjusted to a pH of 7 (e.g., add solid NaOH), and the stirring rate was then increased to 800 rpm, and then to 1600 rpm. The aqueous polymer solution was stirred for 15-20 min until the temperature reached 80-90° C. The resulting mixture was then homogenized with a Silverson homogenizer equipped with a Square Hole workhead and Axial Flow workhead. The homogenizer stirring speed was gradually increased to 4800±200 rpm and mixed for 35 min. until a thick homogeneous gel was obtained.

5911,5911,"BACKGROUND
",0,US10364382-20190730.txt,0
5912,5912,"A wide variety of curable polysiloxane compositions are known. Many of these curable polysiloxane compositions are moisture-curable. The curable compositions can be used to prepare a wide range of surface coatings and surface treatments, ranging from release coatings to pressure sensitive adhesives. The moisture-curable polysiloxane compositions cure in the presence of moisture to form crosslinked materials. The moisture for curing is typically obtained from the atmosphere or from a substrate to which the composition has been applied, although it can also be added to the composition (for example, to enable curing in depth or in confinement).
",0,US10364382-20190730.txt,0
5913,5913,"Moisture-curable polysiloxane compositions usually comprise siloxane polymers having groups (for example, alkoxysilyl or acyloxysilyl moieties) that can react in the presence of moisture to form cured (that is, crosslinked) materials. Moisture-curable compositions comprising alkoxysilyl or acyloxysilyl functionality typically cure in two reactions. In the first reaction, the alkoxysilyl or acyloxysilyl groups hydrolyze in the presence of moisture and a catalyst to form silanol compounds having hydroxysilyl groups. In the second reaction, the hydroxysilyl groups condense with other hydroxysilyl, alkoxysilyl, or acyloxysilyl groups in the presence of a catalyst to form —Si—O—Si— linkages. The two reactions occur essentially simultaneously upon generation of the silanol compound. Commonly used catalysts for the two reactions include Bronsted and Lewis acids. A single material can catalyze both reactions. Generally, it is desirable that the hydrolysis and condensation reactions proceed quickly after the moisture-curable composition has been applied, for example, to a substrate. At the same time, however, the reactions must not occur prematurely, for example, during processing or storage.
",0,US10364382-20190730.txt,0
5914,5914,"A variety of approaches have been used for providing moisture-curable compositions that have acceptable cure rates without processing and storage difficulties. For example, two-part systems have been developed (one part comprising a functional siloxane polymer and the other part comprising a catalyst), with the two parts being mixed immediately prior to use. While this approach has been useful in small-scale applications, it has been less efficient for large-scale manufacturing, where delays caused by having to mix the two parts have been undesirable. Furthermore, coating operations must be completed expeditiously before the composition cures in the pot, and this has been difficult when working with large surface area substrates or a large volume of composition.
",0,US10364382-20190730.txt,0
5915,5915,"A related curing technology involves the condensation reaction between two silanol groups (—SiOH). The condensation reaction is, in effect, the second reaction of the moisture-curable system, in which the silanol groups are already present and need not be generated by hydrolysis of alkoxysilyl or acyloxysilyl groups. The condensation reaction also generates the same type of —Si—O—Si— linkage and generates a molecule of water as a byproduct. Many of the same types of catalysts and curing techniques applicable to moisture-curable siloxanes are applicable to this condensation as well.

5925,5925,"There remains an ongoing need for curable polysiloxane compositions that can provide acceptable cure rates without significant processing and storage difficulties (for example, due to premature gelation). It is desirable that these compositions be efficiently processable (for example, without the need for mixing of a two-part system prior to cure), will employ catalysts that do not generate species requiring removal, and/or will not require heat activation (so as to enable curing at relatively low temperatures and/or the use of heat-sensitive substrates). It is also desirable that the compositions employ catalysts that are relatively non-toxic, provide compositions that are relatively stable in solution but are relatively fast-curing upon drying, and are effective in relatively low concentrations. Ideally, the compositions will be curable on demand (for example, by generation of the catalyst in situ) and coatable without the need for significant addition of solvent (for example, in 100 percent solids form).

In some embodiments, the photoactivatable composition comprises tetraphenyl borate salts of protonated cations of the above-described bases. The tetraphenyl borate salts may be readily generated by protonating the base with an aqueous acid, such as for example, hydrochloric acid, to generate a salt of the protonated base with a Cl − counteranion. The Cl − counteranion can readily be replaced with a tetraphenyl borate anion (Ph 4 B − ) by a metathesis reaction in water, by mixing the protonated base solution with an aqueous solution of, for example, sodium tetraphenyl borate. The [protonated base + ][Ph 4 B − ] salt generally precipitates from water and can be isolated by, for example, filtration or centrifugation, and washed with water and other solvents. Upon isolation, additional purification steps can be carried out, such as recrystallization, if desired. Suitable preparative methods include those described by X.

6285,6285,"BACKGROUND
",0,US10406385-20190910.txt,0
6286,6286,"Skin is the first barrier to environmental exposures such as ultraviolet radiation, which is divided into UVC radiation (200-280 nm), UVB radiation (280-320 nm) and UVA radiation (320-400 nm). Compared to UVC radiation, which is predominately filtered by the ozone layer, UVB radiation is mainly absorbed by the epidermis and can induce skin cancers in animals due to DNA damage (Hussein. J Cutan Pathol, 2005. 32: p. 15; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). UVA radiation can penetrate through dermis to subcutaneous tissues and induce various biological responses, ranging from erythema to photoaging (Zanatta et al. Food and Chemical Toxicology, 2010. 48(1): p. 70-75; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). It is now recognized that both UVA and UVB wavelengths, received during daily exposure to sun, contribute to chronic photodamage of human skin (Gonzalez et al. Clin Dermatol, 2008. 26(6): p. 614-26; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Adequate protection against solar UV exposure can prevent cellular and molecular changes that lead to photoaging, photoimmunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis (Seite. Photodermatology Photoimmunology Photomedicine, 2000. 16; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).
",0,US10406385-20190910.txt,0
6287,6287,"There are 17 active sunscreen ingredients currently approved by the FDA, including various organic and inorganic compounds that are used as filters to help prevent skin damage. Some of these compounds may have adverse effects such as contact sensitivity, increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, and estrogenicity (Sambandan & Ratner. J Am Acad Dermatol, 2011. 64(4): p. 748-58; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Organic chemicals, such as avobenzone, are strong absorbers; whereas, inorganic compounds, such as zinc or titanium oxides, use scattering and absorption mechanisms for protection. Although zinc oxide is the most efficient at protecting against both UVA and UVB radiation, products that use this ingredient leave an undesirable opaque and often dense film on the skin, making their proper use uncomfortable due to increased retained body heat and cosmetically unpleasing. This problem is more prominent for people with darker shades of skin color. Although nanoparticle versions of the metal oxides appear to have better skin application and spreading properties, they only marginally improve the aesthetically unpleasing effect when used on skin and the safety and fate of the nanoparticles in the human body remain a concern (Sambandan & Ratner. J Am Acad Dermatol, 2011. 64(4): p. 748-58; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The use of avobenzone eliminates the consistency and aesthetic problems encountered with metal oxides, but sunscreen formulations that use it require chemical photostabilizers in order for the protective absorption spectra to be maintained for a 2 to 3-hour duration (Gonzalez et al. Clin Dermatol, 2008. 26(6): p. 614-26; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The efficacy of avobenzone is also very sensitive to the ingredients used in the sunscreen formulation (Beasley. Am J Clin Dermatol, 2010. 11(6): p. 10; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). As for other small molecular UV absorbers such as aminobenzoates and benzophenones for topical application, their safety remains a concern (Gonzalez et al. Clin Dermatol, 2008. 26(6): p. 614-26; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Hence, there is a need for new materials that protect from UVA and UVB radiation that are safe, effective, inexpensive, and can be easily formulated for a skin application that is aesthetically pleasing and therefore would be used by many more people to help curb the rising rates of skin cancer.

6323,6323,"Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and its reduced derivative, panthenol, have been studied and used for improving stratum corneum hydration, reducing trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), and maintaining normal epithelial function. Topical application of panthenol at concentrations of 2-5% has been shown to stimulate the regeneration of injured skin (Wiederholt, et al. Experimental Dermatology, 2009. 18(11): p. 969-978; Ebner et al. Am J Clin Dermatol, 2002. 3(6): p. 7; herein incorporated by reference in their entireties).

Pantothenic Acid. 2012: p. 339-348; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Furthermore, pantothenate analogues or derivatives have been investigated to control the overall rate of CoA biosynthesis, demonstrating that derivative compounds of panthenol can have similar biological activity as the parent compound (Spry et al.

The oligochromophore is unique in that it is only produced when panthenol is reacted with citric acid and not with other α-hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid, DL-lactic acid, DL-malic acid, as well as itaconic acid and tricarballylic acid, and has very strong absorption in the UVA and UVB radiation ranges. The oligochromophores are relatively viscous and water-soluble, with an aciditiy of 3.2±0.2. Compared to quinine sulfate, the oligochromophores show excellent photostability under continuous illumination at 350 nm for 10 minutes, even after storage at room temperature for 10 days (e.g., no significant photobleaching was observed).

6377,6377,"To identify the chromophore structure in the oligomer, representative compounds of the decomposition products of panthenol, pantolactone and β-alanol were also reacted with citric acid under the same condition (120° C. for 2 hours). Chemical characterization showed citric acid was first reacted with the amide of panthenol and dehydrated to form a six-membered ring after imide formation. 3-amino-1-propanol was reacted with citric acid to further characterize the reaction that occurs for chromophore formation. 1H and COSY NMR spectra confirmed the unique proton peak of dehydrated citric acid at 2.2 ppm (assigned as 7) due to conjugated electrons that resulted in the chemical shift of citric acid (2.5-2.7 ppm) as shown in FIG. 2 . The split peaks at 1531 cm-1 of N—H and N—O, and decreased peak at 1647 cm-1 of C═O in amide bonds, as well as the new peak of imide bonds at 1780 cm-1 in the ATR FTIR spectra show that carboxylic groups reacted with amide bonds and adjacent hydroxyl groups of panthenol. Panthenol citrate (PAN-CA) showed the characteristic peak of C═C stretching at 1703 cm-1 that is in the same position with itaconic acid in PAN-IA, PAN-IA-CA and PAN-IA-CA-PEG. This indicates the formation of double bonds between panthenol and citric acid, suggesting the presence of a new structure. The chromophore, 6-oxo-3,4-dihydo-2H, 6H-pyrido(2,1-b]oxazine-8-carboxylic acid, is 196.21 Da observed in HPLC-ESI MS spectra with exact mass at 195 Da, meanwhile multiple peaks in 214, 232, 445 and 659 m/z again demonstrated the dehydration of citric acid and the imide ring formation of panthenol citrate, indicating that panthenol is decomposed to β-alanol and pantoic acid in the acidic condition or in the presence of citric acid and β-alanol further reacts with citric acid to from the chromophores that are attached to 6-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H,6H-pyrido(2,1-b]oxazine-8-carboxylic acid ( FIG. 14 ).

Thermoresponsive photoluminsescent hydrogels were synthesized by reacting the condensation product of citric acid, panthenol, polyethylene glycol and itaconic acid (PAN-CA-IA-PEG) with N-isopropylacrylamide via free radical to form PAN-PPCIN. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) for PAN-PPCIN (100 mg/ml, pH=7.4) was 33° C. and the excitation and emission wavelengths of the gel did no change ( FIG. 3 ), while intensities showed the concentration dependence. The storage and loss moduli for PAN-PPCIN and PPCIN at room temperature were 12.7±0.3 MPa and 14.9±0.2 MPa and 0.72±0.1 MPa and 0.42±0.08 MPa, respectively.

These PPOC elastomers were photoluminescent with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 440 nm. Tensile strength, Young's modulus and elongation-at-break of panthenol citrate elastomers increased significantly with the incorporation of panthenol when compared to poly(1,8 octanediol citrate) (POC) ( FIG. 4 ). A small amount of panthenol resulted in tensile strength and Young's modulus of 2.52±0.29 MPa and 3.03±0.38 MPa, respectively, double the values of the strength and modulus of POC synthesized under the same reaction condition. Photoluminescent elastomers were also successfully synthesized by post-polymerizing the prepolymer of poly(1,8 octanediol citrate) in the presence of panthenol. Panthenol can effectively increase the elasticities and flexibilities of polydiolcitrate elastomers. Using this method, the structure of panthenol is better preserved and we observe slow release of panthenol over time from the elastomer.

In particular, the following samples were evaluated: (1) panthenol, (2) citric acid, (3) panthenol citrate. There was no toxicity observed for all three cell types at low doses (<0.1 mg/ml). At higher concentrations (1 mg/ml), HUVEC cells treated with citric acid, died within 24 hours while there was no significant difference between cells exposed to panthenol and panthenol citrate ( FIG. 5 ), HDF cell proliferation was inhibited when treated at higher concentrations of citric acid and panthenol citrate (>1 mg/ml). Viability of both HUVEC and HEKa cells decreased to 50% at higher doses of panthenol citrate (>3 mg/ml). Similarly, in vitro cytocompability of PPCIN and PAN-PPCIN thermoresponsive hydrogels were evaluated by culturing with HEKa and HDF cells. The cells were round and aggregated inside the hydrogels with incubation time. Live/Dead assay showed both types of cells survived in PPCIN hydrogel for 24 hours. However, cell viability decreased in PAN-PPCIN hydrogel synthesized at 10 mol % panthenol. Due to degradation of PAN-PPCIN hydrogel, the released panthenol citrate in higher concentration may have caused the decrease in cell viability. Compared to HEKa cells in PPCIN hydrogel, HDF cells were more viable at 24 hours. UVA radiation can generate oxidative stress in the mitochrondia of keratinocytes. 1 mg/ml panthenol citrate can effectively suppress the generation of superoxide. Both panthenol citrate and PAN-PPCIN with panthenol citrate can scanvenge radicals as per the ABTS assay results.

The maximum absorbance of panthenol citrate oligomers is adjustable by incorporating itaconic acid and/or polyethylene glycol. Both PPCIN and PAN-PPCIN hydrogel (100 mg/ml pH=7.4) can perform endothermic phase changes under direct exposure in 365 nm wavelength UVA radiation, however PAN-PPCIN hydrogel shows a delayed phase transition at 120 seconds due to fluorescent emission. Photoluminescent hydrogels likely reflected UV irradiance and decreased photothermal conversion efficiency minimizing UV burn damage. Compared to naked skin under UVA radiation, both PPCIN and PAN-PPCIN hydrogels reduced changes in the skin after exposure to UVA and UVB.

6419,6419,"Polyurethane foams in pillows and mattresses have a tendency to store heat, which has the disadvantage of the user feeling an uncomfortable rise in temperature during use. Gels based on traditional polyurethane gel technology, which may be characterized by the presence of a solid elastomeric matrix combined with a plasticizer (liquid non-reactive component), has been proposed for use with polyurethane foams counterbalance the rise in temperature observed by the user. However, the plasticizer is not bonded to the polymeric matrix and it may migrate. The migration of the plasticizer may cause various negative effects such as leakage of plasticizer, progressive loss of elasticity, and/or increase in brittleness of the traditional polyurethane gel. Accordingly, alternative gels that minimize and/or avoid the use of the plasticizers are sought.

",0,US10435500-20191008.txt,0
6424,6424,"Embodiments relate to a polyurethane based gel that excludes any plasticizers for use in comfort applications. By plasticizer it is meant an additive added to increase the plasticity or fluidity of a material. For this application, a plasticizer is defined as different from polyol components in a polyurethane formulation and catalytic/curative components in a polyurethane formulation. For example, polyol components are typically regarded as reactive components in polyurethane formulations, while a plasticizer may be embedded within matrices formed by reactive components in polyurethane formulations. By polyurethane gel used in comfort applications, it is meant a gel that utilizes polyurethane reactive chemistry for use as surface toppers or coatings to improve thermal comfort in comfort applications such as pillows and mattresses. With respect to the embodiments, the gel is defined as having a Shore hardness 00 that is 30 or less (e.g., from 5 to 30, from 23 to 30, etc.). Improved thermal comfort is defined as exhibiting a specific heat that is greater than 1.5 J/g*° C. (e.g., from 1.6 to 3.0 J/g*° C., from 1.8 to 2.5 J/g*° C., from 1.8 to 2.2 J/g*° C., etc.) and a thermal conductivity that is greater than 0.120 Watt/m*° K (e.g., from 0.130 to 0.200, from 0.135 to 0.180, from 0.140 to 0.160, etc.)

6425,6425,"The polyurethane gel is a reaction product of a composition that includes a prepolymer component that has an diphenylemethane diisocyanate (MDI) based prepolymer and a prepolymer-reactive component that has an amine-terminated polyol (e.g., a diamine derived polyol such as an ethylenediamine based polyol). The prepolymer component accounts for 5 wt % to 35 wt % (e.g., 7 wt % to 30 wt %, 8 wt % to 25 wt %, etc.), of the total weight of the composition for forming the polyurethane gel. The remainder of the composition for forming the polyurethane gel is the prepolymer-reactive component. The prepolymer-reactive component may include, in addition to the amine-terminated polyol, at least one additional polyol, at least one catalyst, and/or at least one other additive, besides a plasticizer, that is known in the art for use in polyurethane gels. The amine-terminated polyol accounts for 0.5 wt % to 10 wt % (e.g., 0.5 wt % to 5.0 wt %, 1.0 wt % to 3.0 wt %, 1.0 wt % to 2.0 wt %, etc.) based on the total weight of the composition for forming polyurethane gel. The at least one additional polyol may account for 6.0 wt % to 94.5 wt % (e.g., 50.0 wt % to 94.0 wt %, 60.0 wt % to 94.0 wt %, 80.0 wt % to 94.0 wt %, 85.0 wt % to 92.0 wt %, etc.) As is known in the art, the isocyanate index for forming the polyurethane gel may be less than 100, whereas isocyanate index is the ratio of isocyanate reactive groups in the prepolymer to the isocyanate-reactive groups in the prepolymer-reactive component, multiplied by 100.

6496,6496,"Rosin esters, including rosin esters derived from polyhydric alcohols, have been known for more than 50 years. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 1,820,265 to Bent, et al. Rosin esters are typically formed by the reaction of rosin, which is primarily a mixture of isomeric C 20 tricyclic mono-carboxylic acids known as rosin acids, with alcohols such as glycerol or pentaerythritol. The resultant rosin esters serve as additives in a variety of applications, including as tackifiers in hot-melt and pressure-sensitive adhesives, modifiers for rubbers and various plastics, emulsifiers for synthetic rubbers, base materials for chewing gum, resins in coating compositions such as traffic paints and inks, and sizing agents for paper making.
",0,US10435586-20191008.txt,0
6497,6497,"While suitable for many applications, many existing rosin esters fail to possess suitable properties for particular applications. Notably, many commercially available rosin esters are colored (e.g., yellow or yellowish brown) and exhibit poor oxidative stability. Furthermore, many existing rosin esters do not comply with current regulatory standards for use in food packaging applications. In addition, the balance between tack, peel, and shear properties of many existing liquid rosin ester-based pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) is not optimal. Finally, many existing rosin esters are relatively polar compounds that may be incompatible with less polar polymers, such as polyolefins. Accordingly, there continues to be a need for rosin-based compositions which exhibit improved properties.

6516,6516,"Provided herein are oligoesters and oligoester compositions. An oligoester composition of the present disclosure may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of the oligoesters disclosed herein. In an aspect, the oligoester composition comprises from 1 weight percent (wt. %) to 100 wt. % of one or more oligoesters of the type disclosed herein based on the total weight of the composition, alternatively from 10 wt. % to 100 wt. %, alternatively from 20 wt. % to 80 wt. %, alternatively from 30 wt. % to 70 wt. %. In some aspects the oligoester composition comprises equal to or less than about 20 wt. % of any non-oligoester based on the weight of the oligoester composition, alternatively less than 10 wt. %, or alternatively less than 5 wt. %. The oligoester compositions may exhibit improved color (e.g., the oligoester may have a neat Gardner color of 7 or less), improved oxidative stability (e.g., the oligoester composition may exhibit an oxidative-induction time at 110° C. of at least 30 minutes), improved color stability (e.g., the oligoester may exhibit less than a 10% change in neat Gardner color when heated to a temperature of 160° C. for a period of three hours), or combinations thereof.

6517,6517,"In certain aspects, the oligoester compositions may be suitable for use in materials (e.g., adhesives) approved for food contact. For example, in some aspects, the oligoester may meet the definition of a polymer under the European REACH regulations, and comply with the requirements set forth in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 of Jan. 14, 2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food. In particular aspects, more than 50% by weight of the oligoester composition comprises “polymer molecules” (i.e., molecules formed from three or more monomer units covalently bound together), and none of the “polymer molecules” having the same molecular weight account for more than 50 weight percent of the oligoester composition. These values can be determined by means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of the oligoester composition. Integration of the relevant parts of the resulting GPC graph will deliver an approximate value of the weight percentage of “polymer molecules” and an approximate value of the weight percentage of “polymer molecules” having the same molecular weight, respectively. In certain aspects, the oligoester composition may have a weight average molecular weight of at least 700 g/mol (e.g., a weight average molecular weight of from 1,000 g/mol to 5,000 g/mol). In certain aspects, less than 35 percent by weight (e.g., less than 20 percent by weight, or less than 10 percent by weight) of the oligoester composition has a molecular weight of less than 1,000 g/mol. In certain aspects, less than 25 percent by weight (e.g., less than 10 percent by weight, or less than 4 percent by weight, or less than 2 percent by weight) of the oligoester composition has a molecular weight of less than 500 g/mol as determined by GPC.

6518,6518,"The oligoester compositions described herein may be derived from one or more rosins. Rosin, also called colophony or Greek pitch (Pix græca), is a solid hydrocarbon secretion of plants, typically of conifers such as pines (e.g., Pinus palustris and Pinus caribaea ). Rosin may include a mixture of rosin acids, with the precise composition of the rosin varying depending in part on the plant species. Rosin acids are C20 fused-ring monocarboxylic acids with a nucleus of three fused six-carbon rings containing double bonds that vary in number and location. Examples of rosin acids include abietic acid, neoabietic acid, dehydroabietic acid, dihydroabietic acid, pimaric acid, levopimaric acid, sandaracopimaric acid, isopimaric acid, and palustric acid. Natural rosin typically consists of a mixture of several primarily abietic-type and pimaric-type acids in combination with minor amounts of other components.

6519,6519,"Rosin is commercially available, and may be obtained from pine trees by distillation of oleoresin (gum rosin being the residue of distillation), by extraction of pine stumps (wood rosin) or by fractionation of tall oil (tall oil rosin). Any type of rosin may be used to prepare the oligoester compositions described herein, including tall oil rosin, gum rosin and wood rosin and mixtures thereof. If desired, rosin may be subjected to one or more purification steps (e.g., distillation under reduced pressure, extraction, and/or crystallization) prior its use as a rosin in the esterifying steps described herein. Hydrogenated rosins and partially hydrogenated rosins may also be used as a rosin source. An example of commercially available hydrogenated rosin suitable for use in the present disclosure is FORAL™ AX-E, which is marketed by Eastman Chemical Company. Examples of commercially available hydrogenated rosin include without limitation STAYBELITE™ Resin-E, which is marketed by Eastman Chemical Company, and HYDROGAL™, which is marketed by DRT (Dérivés Résiniques et Terpéniques).

They combine simultaneously a liquid like character to enable them to flow and form good molecular contact upon application of light pressure in a short contact time as well as solid like character to resist to an applied stress after adhesive bond formation. Three main properties for pressure sensitive adhesives are tack, shear and peel resistance. Peel adhesion is defined as the force required to remove pressure sensitive coated material, which has been applied to a standard test plate under specified conditions from the plate at a specified angle and speed. The ‘loop’ tack value of a pressure sensitive material is expressed as the force required to separate, at a specified speed, a loop of material (adhesive outermost) which has been brought into contact with a specified area of a standard surface. Resistance to shear from a standard surface is defined as the time required for a standard area of pressure sensitive coated material to slide from a standard flat surface in a direction parallel to the surface.

6622,6622,"The oligoester compositions described herein may also be prepared by a transesterification process, wherein esters of the carboxylic acid-containing components of the oligoester are reacted with one or more polyhydric alcohols. In the case of polyhydric alcohols that have reacted with carboxylic acids, some free unreacted polyhydric alcohol hydroxyl groups may remain which may react in a transesterification reaction with esters and result in an exchange of their alkoxy groups. Such a transesterification reaction is an equilibrium reaction wherein new oligoester compositions may be formed. Accordingly, in some aspects, methods for preparing oligoester compositions may comprise reacting one or more rosin esters having a hydroxyl value greater than zero with one or more esters derived from monocarboxylic acids and optionally one or more polycarboxylic acids. In some aspects, an alcohol or a polyhydric alcohol may be added to trigger or accelerate such a transesterification reaction. Optionally, the transesterifying step may comprise contacting the mixture and the one or more polyhydric alcohols with an esterification catalyst (e.g., calcium-bis (((3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)methylphosphonate)). In other aspects, the transesterifying step may comprise contacting the mixture and the one or more polyhydric alcohols in the absence of an esterification catalyst. Nonlimiting examples of esters of the carboxylic acid-containing components of the oligoester which may be used in such a transesterification process are vegetable oils (e.g., triglyceride vegetable oils) and animal fats and oils which include oils such as palm oil, linseed oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, olive oil, tung oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, palm kernel oil, soybean oil, corn oil, grapeseed oil, hazelnutoil, rice bran oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, butterfat, and coconut oil as well as hydrogenated oils and deodorized oils.

6623,6623,"The oligoester compositions described herein may also be prepared by an interesterification process, which is mechanistically related to esterification and transesterification. Interesterification may be carried out by blending different esters and then rearranging the carboxylic acid moieties over the applied polyhydric alcohol backbones in the presence of a catalyst, for example an esterification catalyst. Interesterifications are equilibrium reactions. By way of an example, a rosin ester may be reacted with a triglyceride ester, such as rapeseed oil. Such an interesterification reaction would afford an oligoester wherein the fatty acid moieties in the triglyceride ester are partly substituted by rosin acid moieties, and wherein the rosin acid moieties in the rosin ester are partly substituted by fatty acid moieties.

An example of partial esters are partial glycerides, which are esters of glycerol with fatty acids where not all the hydroxyl groups are esterified. cis-HOOC—CH═CH—COOCH3 is an example of a half ester derived from maleic acid. Adipic acid monomethyl ester and adipic acid monoethyl ester are examples of half esters derived from adipic acid. As in the methods above, the removal of the water or volatile monoalcohols formed as the reaction proceeds may shift the reaction equilibrium to favor product formation and thereby drive the reaction towards completion.

6625,6625,"Reactants based on monocarboxylic acids having a modified carboxyl group or polycarboxylic acids having one or more modified carboxyl groups may be used in place of the monocarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acids, respectively. For example, partial esters and half esters, as described above, may be used in place of polycarboxylic acids. Other examples include anhydrides, thioesters and carbonyl chlorides, also called acyl chlorides or acid chlorides, which may be substituted for monocarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acids. In general these structurally related reactants contain an acyl group that may react with a nucleophile (e.g., the hydroxyl group of a polyhydric alcohol) via a nucleophilic acyl substitution mechanism.

For example, succinic anhydride, also called dihydro-2,5-furandione, may be applied instead of succinic acid and palmitic anhydride may be applied instead of palmitic acid. Trimellitic anhydride may be applied instead of trimellitic acid. Analogously, an acid chloride, may be applied as a reactant instead of the corresponding carboxylic acid or may be applied instead of an ester derived from the corresponding carboxylic acid. For example, methyl adipoyl chloride, also called adipic acid monomethyl ester chloride, may be applied as a reactant instead of adipic acid or adipic acid dimethyl ester, adipic acid diethyl ester, adipic acid monomethyl ester, adipic acid monoethyl ester or adipoyl chloride.

Fortification of rosin involves the chemical modification of the conjugated double bond system of rosin acids in the rosin, so as to provide a rosin having a lower PAN number and higher molecular weight than the rosin prior to fortification. For example, rosins may be fortified by means of a Diels-Alder or Ene addition reaction of a rosin acid with a dienophile, such as an α,β-unsaturated organic acid or the anhydride of such an acid. Examples of suitable dienophiles include maleic acid, fumaric acid, acrylic acid, esters derived from these acids, and maleic anhydride.

The relative amounts of applied carboxylic acids and polyhydric alcohol may play an important role herein. A stoichiometric excess of carboxylic acid functionality versus polyhydric alcohol functionality will in general lead to oligoester compositions having a low or negligible hydroxyl number. From a chemistry perspective it means that more moles of carboxylic acid moieties (carboxyl moieties), as compared to the number of moles of total polyhydric alcohol hydroxyl moieties, may be applied in the esterification reaction. In some aspects, the reactant mixture prior to the start of the oligoester synthesis may contain a stoichiometric molar ratio of total hydroxyl functionality to total carboxyl functionality of 1.40 or less (e.g., 1.10 or less, 1.05 or less, 1.00 or less, or 0.95 or less, or from 1.00 to 1.15).

This process may involve chemical modification of residual hydroxyl moieties in the oligoester or hydrogenated oligoester following esterification using suitable synthetic methods For example, the oligoester or hydrogenated oligoester may be reacted with an acylating agent (e.g., a carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, such as an acid anhydride). See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,380,513 to Ruckel. Residual hydroxyl moieties in the oligoester or hydrogenated oligoester may also be reacted with an electrophilic reagent, such as an isocyanate, to produce the corresponding carbamate derivative.

7284,7284,"Polyether polycarbonate polyols are polyols containing carbon dioxide in the bonded form of the carbonate. Since many processes in the chemical industry generate carbon dioxide in large amounts as a by-product, the use of carbon dioxide as a comonomer in alkylene oxide polymerizations is of particular interest from a commercial viewpoint. Partial replacement of alkylene oxides in polyols by carbon dioxide has the potential to greatly reduce costs for the production of polyols. The use of CO 2 as a comonomer is also very advantageous from an ecological viewpoint, since this reaction represents the conversion of a greenhouse gas into a polymer. The preparation of polyether polycarbonate polyols by addition of alkylene oxides and carbon dioxide onto H-functional starter substances by use of catalysts is well known. Various catalyst systems may be used here: The first generation were heterogenous zinc or aluminum salts, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,424 or 3,953,383. Mono- and binuclear metallic complexes have further been successfully used for copolymerization of CO2 and alkylene oxides (WO 2010/028362, WO 2009/130470, WO 2013/022932 or WO 2011/163133). The most important class of catalyst systems for the copolymerization of carbon dioxide and alkylene oxides is that of the double metal cyanide catalysts, also known as DMC catalysts (U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,704, WO 2008/058913). Suitable alkylene oxides and H-functional starter substances are those also used for preparing carbonate-free polyether polyols, as described above.

7285,7285,"Natural oil based polyols (NOPs), i.e. polyols based on renewable raw materials, for producing polyurethane foams, have been the object of increasing interest in view of the fact that the availability of fossil resources, viz. mineral oil, coal and gas, is limited in the long run and against the background of rising crude oil prices, and have already been extensively described in such uses (WO 2005/033167; US 2006/0293400, WO 2006/094227, WO 2004/096882, US 2002/0103091, WO 2006/116456 and EP 1678232). In the meantime, a whole series of these polyols have become commercially available from various producers (WO2004/020497, US2006/0229375, WO2009/058367). Depending on the source of the raw material (e.g. soybean oil, palm oil or castor oil) and the subsequent processing, the polyols obtained differ in their range of properties. Essentially two groups are distinguishable here: a) natural oil based polyols modified such that they are 100% usable for production of polyurethanes (WO2004/020497, US2006/0229375); b) natural oil based polyols which, owing to their processing and properties, are capable of replacing petrochemically based polyol to a certain extent only (WO2009/058367).

The solid thus acts as an essential processing aid. A further function is to control the hardness via the solids content, since higher solids contents bring about a higher hardness on the part of the foam. The formulations with solids-containing polyols are distinctly less self-stable and therefore tend to require physical stabilization in addition to the chemical stabilization due to the crosslinking reaction.

7437,7437,"In line with the technical teaching of G. Jenner et al. (Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 373, 1989, 343-352), a 500 ml laboratory autoclave fitted with a stirring device, a heatable jacket, a pressure transducer and a temperature probe and also an inert gas feed line was initially charged with 64.0 g (0.9 mol) of pyrrolidine, 63.7 g (600 mmol) of diethylene glycol, 1.17 g (4.5 mmol) of ruthenium(III) chloride trihydrate (0.75 mol %, based on diol) and 3.54 g (13.5 mmol) of triphenylphosphine. The autoclave was sealed and nitrogen inertized, and the jacket was heated with a thermal oil to 190° C., and the pressure was observed to rise. The reaction temperature was then maintained for 9 hours under agitation, and the pressure was observed to fall continuously. On completion of the reaction time the reaction mixture was left to cool down to room temperature and analyzed by gas chromatography. The analysis, in addition to unconverted pyrrolidine, showed a ratio of 16:84 of monoadduct to diadduct. The crude reaction mixture was admixed with a little filter aid and filtered through a pleated filter, and the filtrate was then subjected to a fine distillation. This gave a clear fraction of 9.2 g of the monoadduct (60% of theory) and 68.5 g (64% of theory) of the clear and slightly oily desired diadduct of formula (III). NMR spectroscopy as well as GC or GC/MS analyses confirmed product formation. Depending on the reaction composition and mode of operation, different technical-grade product mixtures, such as those described above for example, were obtainable in the reaction. Nevertheless, it was preferable here to obtain a highly pure fraction of the compound of formula (III).

The requirements within the automotive industry only allow very low emissions or almost no emissions of aldehydes, such as formaldehyde, and dimethylformamide from these polyurethane foams. Instead of using the CERTIPUR standard test method, a more stringent test method has to be used, namely the VDA 276 test method. Up to now, none of the state of the art methods is suitable to achieve very low to almost no aldehyde emissions from these polyurethane foams when using the VDA 276 test method. Some automotive OEM's specify formaldehyde emissions lower than 30 μg/m 3 for 1 kg foam measured according to the VDA 276 test method.
