35,35,"DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
36,36,"The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that employing a nucleotide associated with a positively charged amphiphile may increase the association of the nucleotide with the cochleate and facilitate bioavailability of the nucleotide.

40,40,"As used herein, the terms “cochleate,” “lipid precipitate” and “precipitate” are used interchangeably to refer to a lipid precipitate component that generally includes alternating cationic and lipid bilayer sheets with little or no internal aqueous space, typically stacked and/or rolled up, wherein the cationic sheet is comprised of one or More multivalent cations. Additionally, the term “encochleated” means associated with the cochleate structure, e.g., by incorporation into the cationic sheet, and/or inclusion in the lipid bilayer.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
41,41,"As used herein, the term “multivalent cation” refers to a divalent cation or higher valency cation, or any compound that has at least two positive charges, including mineral cations such as calcium, barium, zinc, iron and magnesium and other elements, such as drugs and other compounds, capable of forming ions or other structures having multiple positive charges capable of chelating and bridging negatively charged lipids. Additionally or alternatively, the multivalent cation can include other multivalent cationic compounds, e.g., cationic or protonized cargo moieties.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
42,42,"The term “aliphatic group” includes organic moieties characterized by straight or branched-chains, typically having between 1 and 24 carbon atoms. In complex structures, the chains may be branched, bridged, or cross-linked. Aliphatic groups include aliphatic groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, and any combination thereof.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
43,43,"As used herein, “alkyl” groups include saturated hydrocarbons having one or more carbon atoms, e.g., between 1 and 24 carbon atoms, including straight-chain alkyl groups (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, etc.) and branched-chain alkyl groups (isopropyl, tert-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, etc.). It is to be understood that both straight-chain and branched-chain alkyl groups are encompassed by the term “alkyl”.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
44,44,"In certain embodiments, a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group may have 30 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone, e.g., C 1 -C 30 for straight-chain or C 3 -C 30 for branched-chain. In certain embodiments, a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group may have 20 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone, e.g., C 1 -C 20 for straight-chain or C 3 -C 20 for branched-chain, and in more particular embodiments 18 or fewer. The term “C4-C24” as in “C4-C24 alkyl” means alkyl groups containing 4 to 24 carbon atoms.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
45,45,"The terms “alkenyl”, “alkynyl” and “alkenylene” refer to unsaturated aliphatic groups analogous to alkyls, but which contain at least one double or triple carbon-carbon bond respectively.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
46,46,"The term “acyl” refers to a carbonyl group that is attached through its carbon atom to a hydrogen (i.e., a formyl) or an aliphatic group (e.g., acetyl), and the like.

47,47,"The term “nucleoside” refers to a molecule having a purine or pyrimidine base covalently linked to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar. Exemplary nucleosides include adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine and thymidine. The term “nucleotide” refers to a nucleoside having one or more phosphate groups joined in ester linkages to the sugar moiety. Exemplary nucleotides include nucleoside monophosphates, diphosphates and triphosphates. The terms “polynucleotide” and “nucleic acid molecule” are used interchangeably herein and refer to a polymer of nucleotides joined together by a phosphodiester linkage between 5′ and 3′ carbon atoms.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
48,48,"The term “oligonucleotide” refers to a short sequence of nucleotides and/or nucleotide analogs. The term “RNA analog” refers to an polynucleotide (e.g., a chemically synthesized polynucleotide) having at least one altered or modified nucleotide as compared to a corresponding unaltered or unmodified RNA, but retaining the same or similar nature or function as the corresponding unaltered or unmodified RNA. The oligonucleotides may be linked with linkages which result in a lower rate of hydrolysis of the RNA analog as compared to an RNA molecule with phosphodiester linkages. For example, the nucleotides of the analog may comprise methylenediol, ethylene diol, oxymethylthio, oxyethylthio, oxycarbonyloxy, phosphorodiamidate, phosphoroamidate, and/or phosphorothioate linkages. In some embodiments, RNA analogues include sugar- and/or backbone-modified ribonucleotides and/or deoxyribonucleotides. Such alterations or modifications can further include addition of non-nucleotide material, such as to the end(s) of the RNA or internally (at one or more nucleotides of the RNA). An RNA analog need only be sufficiently similar to natural RNA that it has the ability to mediate (mediates) RNA interference.

49,49,"As used herein, an “identical” oligonucleotide has the same sequence as the reference nucleotide subsequence to which the oligonucleotide is being compared. An “exactly complementary” oligonucleotide refers to an oligonucleotide whose complement has the same sequence as the reference nucleotide subsequence to which the oligonucleotide is being compared. A “substantially complementary” and a “substantially identical” oligonucleotide have the ability to specifically hybridize to a reference gene, DNA, cDNA, or mRNA, and its exact complement.

50,50,"An “antisense” oligonucleotide is an oligonucleotide that is substantially complementary to a target nucleotide sequence and has the ability to specifically hybridize to the target nucleotide sequence.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
51,51,"The term “RNA” or “RNA molecule” or “ribonucleic acid molecule” refers to a polymer of ribonucleotides. The term “DNA” or “DNA molecule” or “deoxyribonucleic acid molecule” refers to a polymer of deoxyribonucleotides. DNA and RNA can be synthesized naturally (e.g., by DNA replication or transcription of DNA, respectively). RNA can be post-transcriptionally modified. DNA and RNA can also be chemically synthesized. DNA and RNA can be single-stranded (i.e., ssRNA and ssDNA, respectively) or multi-stranded (e.g., double stranded, i.e., dsRNA and dsDNA, respectively). “mRNA” or “messenger RNA” is single-stranded RNA that specifies the amino acid sequence of one or more polypeptide chains. This information is translated during protein synthesis when ribosomes bind to the mRNA.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
52,52,"As used herein, the term “RNA interference” (“RNAi”) refers to a selective intracellular degradation of RNA to mediate, reduce or silence the expression of a target gene.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
53,53,"As used herein, the term “small interfering RNA” (“siRNA”) (also referred to in the art as “short interfering RNAs”) refers to a double stranded RNA (or RNA analog) comprising between about 10-50 nucleotides (or nucleotide analogs) which is capable of directing or mediating RNA interference.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
54,54,"As used herein, the term “short double stranded DNA” refers to a double stranded DNA (or DNA analog) comprising less than about 50 nucleotides (or nucleotide analogs).
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
55,55,"“Morpholino oligonucleotides” and “morpholinos” are used interchangeably, and refer to oligonucleotides having a morpholino backbone. Morpholinos function by an RNase H-independent mechanism and are soluble in aqueous solutions, with most being freely soluble at mM concentrations (typically 10 mg/ml to over 100 mg/ml). Morpholinos have high affinity for RNA and efficiently invade even quite stable secondary structures in mRNAs, which results in effective and predictable targeting essentially anywhere from the 5′-cap to about +25 of the protein coding region of mRNAs. Morpholinos are free of significant non-antisense effects while the alternative phosphorothioates are plagued by a host of well-documented non-antisense effects. Morpholinos include a morpholine backbone, which is not recognized by nucleases and therefore is stable in the cell compared to phosphorothioates, which typically are degraded in biological systems in a matter of hours. Consequently, considerably fewer morpholinos are required (approximately 100× less) to achieve similar antisense effects. Morpholinos can also be superior to phosphorothioates because targeting is more predictable, the activity in cells is more reliable, and the sequence specificity is superior. Summerton, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1489: 141-158 (1999). Morpholinos can be designed and prepared according to known methods. E.g., Summerton and Weller, Antisense and Nucleic Acid Drug Development 7187-195 (1997).
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
56,56,"As used herein, the terms “ribozyme” and “RNA enzyme” are used interchangeably to refer to RNA molecules that catalyze chemical reactions. In addition to catalyzing cleavage of themselves and/or other RNAs, ribozymes may also catalyze the aminotransferase activity of the ribosome. Ribozymes, although quite rare in cells, often have essential functions, e.g., a role in the ribosomal translation of RNA into proteins. Known ribozymes include, but are not limited to RNase P, Group I and Group II introns, leadzyme, hairpin ribozyme, hammerhead ribozyme, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, and tetrahymena ribozyme. Additionally, ribozymes may be made synthetically, e.g., while maintaining good enzymatic activity. Synthetic ribozymes may have structures similar to naturally occurring ribozymes or may have novel structures.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
57,57,"The term “aptamer,” as used herein, refers generally to single-stranded DNA and RNA molecules that bind target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Aptamers may be selected in vitro from populations of random sequences that recognize specific ligands by forming binding pockets. Aptamers can be chemically synthesized and, although single-stranded, normally have complex three-dimensional shapes. Generally, an aptamer domain on an RNA enzyme, or ribozyme, modulates the activity of the ribozyme. In a manner similar to antibodies, when the shape of the aptamer corresponds to the shape of a target protein, a strongly bound complex can be formed. These aptamers may have potential in targeted delivery of drugs, either through direct conjugation of the drug to an aptamer, or through drug encapsulation in a vesicle, e.g., a liposome, which is coated in an aptamer. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the nucleotides employed in the compositions of the present invention are aptamers. The aptamers may be contained at least partially within the cochleate structure. Alternatively, the aptamers may be coated on the cochleate. The aptamer-cochleate may include additional cargo moieties for targeted delivery.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
58,58,"As used herein, the term “transcription factor decoys” refers to nucleotides, generally oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which are used to inhibit specific transcription factors, e.g., in cell culture. Transcription factor proteins bind specific sequences found in the promoter regions of target genes whose expression they then regulate. These binding sequences are generally 6-10 base pairs in length and are occasionally found in multiple copies within the promoter regions of target genes. A cell can be flooded with transcription factor decoys, which compete for binding of the transcription factor with sequences in target genes. The decoys have the potential to alter the binding and function of the transcription factor, thus regulating the expression of the target gene. At higher concentrations, transcription factor decoys may completely block transcription factor function. Exemplary transcription factor decoys are described, e.g., in Morishita, R., et al., Circ Res, 82, 1023-1028 (1998) and Mann, M. J. and Dzau, V. J., J. Clin. Invest., 106, 1071-1075 (2000). Additional exemplary transcription factor decoys are E2F Decoys, which are DNA-based competitive inhibitor, useful, e.g., in the prevention of bypass graft failure and NF-kB Decoys, useful, e.g., in the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis and other inflammation indications.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
59,59,"A nucleotide “that mediates RNAi against a target mRNA” refers to a nucleotide including a sequence sufficiently complementary to a target RNA (e.g. mRNA or RNA that can be spliced to produce one or more mRNAs) to trigger the destruction of the target mRNA by the RNAi machinery or process or to interfere with translation of the mRNA into a protein.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
60,60,"The term “nucleotide analog” or “altered nucleotide” or “modified nucleotide” refers to a non-standard nucleotide, including non-naturally occurring ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides. In some embodiments, nucleotide analogs are modified at any position so as to alter certain chemical properties of the nucleotide yet retain the ability of the nucleotide analog to perform its intended function. Examples of positions of the nucleotide which may be derivatized include the 5 position, e.g., 5-(2-amino)propyl uridine, 5-bromo uridine, 5-propyne uridine, 5-propenyl uridine, etc.; the 6 position, e.g., 6-(2-amino)propyl uridine; the 8-position for adenosine and/or guanosines, e.g., 8-bromo guanosine, 8-chloro guanosine, 8-fluoroguanosine, etc. Nucleotide analogs also include deaza nucleotides, e.g., 7-deaza-adenosine; and N-modified (e.g., alkylated, e.g., N6-methyl adenosine, or as otherwise known in the art) nucleotides; and other heterocyclically modified nucleotide analogs such as those described in Herdewijn, Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev., 2000 Aug. 10(4):297-310.
",0,US08598138-20131203.txt,0
61,61,"Nucleotide analogs may also comprise modifications to the sugar portion of the nucleotides. For example the 2′OH-group may be replaced by a group selected from H, OR, R, F, Cl, Br, I, SH, SR, NH 2 , NHR, NR 2 , COOR, or OR, wherein R is substituted or unsubstituted C1-C6 alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, etc. Other possible modifications include those described in U.S. Pat.

67,67,"The cochleate structure provides protection from degradation for associated “encochleated” moieties. Divalent cation concentrations in vivo in serum and mucosal secretions are such that the cochleate structure is maintained. Hence, the majority of cochleate-associated molecules, e.g., cargo moieties, are present in the inner layers of a primarily solid, non-aqueous, stable, impermeable structure. Since the cochleate structure includes a series of solid layers, components within the interior of the cochleate structure remain substantially intact, even though the outer layers of the cochleate may be exposed to harsh environmental conditions or enzymes.

The amount of nucleotide incorporated into the cochleates can be varied as desired. The optimal lipid:nucleotide ratio for a desired purpose can readily be determined without undue experimentation. The cochleates can be administered to the targeted host to ascertain the nature and tenor of the biologic response to the administered cochleates. It is evident that the optimized ratio for any one use may range from a high ratio to a low ratio to obtain maximal results. All ratios disclosed herein are w/w, unless otherwise indicated. In one embodiment, the ratio of lipid to nucleotide is between about 10,000:1 and 1000:1. Ratios in this range may be suitable when it is desired to administer small amounts of the nucleotide (e.g., in the case rare or expensive molecules).

151,151,"Formation of the cochleates of the invention in the above methods involves crystallization of multivalent cation with negatively charged lipids. It is evident, therefore, that all of the parameters that govern crystallization, e.g., temperature, lipid concentration, multivalent cation concentrations, rate of cation addition, pH and rate of mixing, can be utilized to regulate cochleate formation. In certain embodiments, ionic conditions can be created or adjusted to affect the efficiency of the association and/or the encochleation of the nucleotide. For example, increasing the salt concentration in a liposomal suspension can render the environment less hospitable to a hydrophobic or amphipathic nucleotide, thereby increasing liposome and cochleate loading efficiency. Ionic conditions can also affect the ultimate structure of the cochleate generated. High loads of a nucleotide can also affect the highly ordered structure observed in cochleates formed, e.g., exclusively from calcium and PS. Additionally or alternatively, pH conditions can be created or adjusted to affect the loading and structure of the resulting cochleates. Such variations can readily be manipulated by the skilled practitioner using no more than the instant specification and routine experimentation. In addition, because a cochleate is highly thermodynamically stable, once a cochleate formulation method is developed for a given product, the end product can be made predictably and reliably.

For example, the pH can be adjusted to about 8.5 or about 6.0 to 6.5 or about 3.0 to 3.5 for a morpholino.

Modulation of the size of cochleates can change the manner in which the nucleotide and/or additional cargo moiety is taken up by cells. For example, in general, small cochleates are taken up quickly and efficiently into cells, whereas larger cochleates are taken up more slowly, but tend to retain efficacy for a longer period of time. Also, in some cases small cochleates are more effective than large cochleates in certain cells, while in other cells large cochleates are more effective than small cochleates.

280,280,"Host immune responses are commonly classified into two distinguishable groups, cellular and humoral. Cellular immunity is mediated by T lymphocytes or T cells and protects against virally infected cells, fungi, parasites, and foreign tissue. Humoral immunity, which is mediated by B lymphocytes or B cells through the production of antibodies, is most effective against bacterial infections and the extracellular phases of viral infections. D. Voet & J. Voet, Biochemistry 1208 (2d ed., Wiley 1995).
",0,US08598312-20131203.txt,0
281,281,"Cellular immune response cascades lead to the destruction of antigens through: 1) the uptake of antigens by cellular macrophages or antigen presenting cells, 2) the processing or fragmentation of the antigen within the macrophage, 3) the association of the fragmented antigen with cell-surface proteins known as the major histocompatibility complex (“MHC”) proteins and 4) binding of the MHC protein/antigen complex by T cells that are induced to propagate, thereby illiciting an effective immune response against the specific antigen. In autoimmune disorders, this cellular immune response cascade recognizes self-derived species as antigens, effectively leading to the destruction of host peptides, cells, and tissues. The process by which the cellular immune system recognizes and initiates a response to antigens, both foreign and self, has been a focus of much research in recent years.
",0,US08598312-20131203.txt,0
282,282,"MHC proteins have been classified into two groups, referred to as Class I and Class II MHC proteins, that are structurally and functionally similar. D. Voet & J. Voet, Id. Macrophages exhibiting Class I MHC proteins or Class II MHC proteins that are complexed with an antigen on their surface are bound by cytotoxic T cells or helper T cells, respectively. As a result of this binding event, T cells are induced to proliferate and trigger an immune response against the antigen. The role of MHC proteins is to present the antigen on the surface of the cell so that they can be recognized by T cells. In humans, the Class I MHC proteins are encoded by three separate genetic loci, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. There are also three heterodimeric human Class II MHC proteins whose alpha and beta chains are encoded by genes designated HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR. Both Class I and Class II MHC genes are highly polymorphic, giving rise to the variance between individuals in the population. Id. Because of the key role of the antigen/MHC complex in the activation of T cells, inhibition of antigen binding to MHC molecules has been a goal of research in autoimmune diseases. Id.

283,283,"In autoimmune diseases, inappropriate triggering of T cell responses by MHC molecule—“self antigen” complexes leads to destruction of normal tissues. Individuals inherit MHC genes of the HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ haplotypes, and these have been linked to specific autoimmune diseases and autoantigens such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In each of these cases, patients diagnosed with the autoimmune disease carry an associated MHC gene. In rheumatoid arthritis, over 80% of patients have either HLA-DR1 or DR4 genes; in multiple sclerosis, ca. 70% have HLA-DR2.

284,284,"Design of inhibitors of the cellular immune response has been a fundamental goal of research that aims to prevent T cell proliferation in autoimmune disease. Yusuf-Makagiansar et. al. (2002) Med. Res. Rev. 22(2):146-167, Adorini, et al., (1988) Nature, 334, 623-625. For example, Astra-Zeneca has a partially stabilized, large peptide analog (ZD 2315) in phase II clinical trials that binds to DR1/4 based on these principles. The compound was shown to be active in vivo in mouse models. Cytel, Inc. developed a partially stabilized peptide (a(Cha)AAAKTAAAAa-NH 2 ) (SEQ ID NO.: 106) that binds DR molecules, but did not supress T cell proliferation in response to protein antigens, and also did not show activity in animal models of autoimmune disease (Lamont, et al. (1990), J. Immunol. 144, 2493-2498; Ishioka, et al., (1994) J. Immunol. 152, 4310-4319. The lack of cellular activity was thought to be inherent to peptides, because they are (a) susceptible to rapid exchange within the endosomal loading compartment in the presence of HLA-DM, and (b) are prone to cleavage by proteolyic enzymes of the cathepsin class that reside in the endosome to process protein antigens.

Med. 188:1511-1520.

With the exception of trauma, multiple sclerosis is the leading cause of neurologic disability in early to middle adulthood.

In people of northern European descent, approximately 70% of multiple sclerosis patients carry the HLA-DR2 gene. Giordano, M. et al. (2002) Am. J. Pharmacogenomics 2:37-58. Accordingly, compounds with the ability to inhibit antigen binding by the MHC class II HLA-DR2 are being sought as effective therapeutics for treating or preventing multiple sclerosis.

Other peptide segments that overlapped with this peptide were also critical for binding to these molecules. It was demonstrated that hydrophobic residues (Val189 and Phe92) in the MBP (88-95) segment were critical for peptide binding to DRB1*1501 molecules and that hydrophobic and charged residues (Phe92, Lys93) in the MBP (89-101/102) sequence contributed to DRB5*0101 binding.

459,459,"In general, amino acids (natural, non-natural, or peptide mimetics) are protected as N-Fmoc derivatives with acid-labile protecting groups as appropriate on reactive side chain substituents. Fmoc-Rink or Knorr linker-BHA resin is used for the synthesis of C-terminal amides. TGT-alcohol resin is used for the synthesis of C-terminal acids. Fmoc groups are removed using 20-40% piperidine in DMF. Condensation of the appropriate N-Fmoc amino acid is accomplished using HBTU/N-methyl morpholine in DMF (the HOBT active ester of the amino acid is preformed and added to the resin). Couplings to N-alkyl or imino acids are performed with either BOP-Cl or PyBrOP in NMP. After deprotection of the Fmoc group using 20-40% piperidine in DMF, coupling of the next N-Fmoc amino acid or capping group is accomplished in the same manner. This cycle is repeated until the desired sequence has been synthesized on the resin.

460,460,"Final deprotection of the N-terminal Fmoc group, if present, is followed by treatment with an acid anhydride, activated carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid in DMF for 1 hour. When C-terminal amides are desired, the resin is washed with DMF, ethanol, methylene chloride and dried in vacuo. The linear compounds are cleaved from the resin and any side chain protecting groups are removed by treatment with a 80% solution of TFA in dichloromethane, with the addition of water (5%) and triisopropylsilane (5%). Filtrates are concentrated in vacuo, and diluted with diethyl ether to afford crude compounds as white solids. Crude products are purified by reverse phase HPLC (C18 silica gel; acetonitrile/water/TFA gradient elution) and lyophilized to give the final compounds. When the sequence includes a basic substitutent, such as an amino group of a lysine, the product may be formed as a TFA salt.

Binding specificity is assessed by adding an excess of non-biotinylated peptide. Background does not significantly differ from that obtained by incubating the biotinylated peptide without MHC II molecules. Data are expressed as the peptide concentration that prevents binding of 50% of the labeled peptide (IC 50 ).

",0,US10052299-20180821.txt,0
610,610,"As an introduction, lipid-forming fatty acids are well-known as one of the major components of living cells. As such, they participate in numerous metabolic pathways, and play an important role in a variety of pathologies. Essential Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) are an important sub-class of fatty acids. An essential nutrient is a food component that directly, or via conversion, serves an essential biological function and which is not produced endogenously or in large enough amounts to cover the requirements. For homeothermic animals, the two rigorously essential PUFAs are linoleic (cis,cis-9,12-Octadecadienoic acid; (9Z,12Z)-9,12-Octadecadienoic acid; LA; 18:2; n-6) and alpha-linolenic (cis,cis,cis-9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid; (9Z,12Z,15Z)-9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid; ALA; 18:3; n-3) acids, formerly known as vitamin F (Cunnane S C. Progress in Lipid Research 2003; 42:544-568). LA, by further enzymatic desaturation and elongation, is converted into higher n-6 PUFAs such as arachidonic (AA; 20:4; n-6) acid; whereas ALA gives rise to a higher n-3 series, including, but not limited to, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5; n-3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA; 22:6; n-3) acid (Goyens P L. et al. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2006; 84:44-53). Because of the essential nature of PUFAs or PUFA precursors, there are many instances of their deficiency. These are often linked to medical conditions. Many PUFA supplements are available over-the-counter, with proven efficiency against certain ailments (For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,271,315, U.S. Pat. No. 7,381,558).
",0,US10052299-20180821.txt,0
611,611,"Brain tissue is particularly rich in PUFAs, which constitute 35% of the phospholipids in the neuronal membranes of the brain (Hamilton J A. et al. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2007; 33:2-11). Three particularly important fatty acids, which are abundant in neuronal membranes, are: LA, which makes up cardiolipin; DHA, deficiencies of which can impede brain development and compromise optimal brain function; and AA, which yields essential, but potentially toxic, metabolic products.
",0,US10052299-20180821.txt,0
612,612,"PUFAs endow membranes, in particular mitochondrial membranes, with appropriate fluidity necessary for optimal oxidative phosphorylation performance. PUFAs also play an important role in initiation and propagation of the oxidative stress. PUFAs react with ROS through a chain reaction that amplifies an original event (Sun M, Salomon R G, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126:5699-5708). Of particular importance is a mitochondrial membrane-specific PUFA-rich phospholipid cardiolipin, vital for electron transport Complex I activity (Paradies G, et al. Gene 2002; 86:135-141).
",0,US10052299-20180821.txt,0
613,613,"Non-enzymatic formation of high levels of lipid hydroperoxides is known to result in several detrimental changes. It negatively affects the fluidity and permeability of the membranes; leads to oxidation of membrane proteins; and these hydroperoxides can be converted into a large number of highly reactive carbonyl compounds. The latter include reactive species such as acrolein, malonic dialdehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, etc (Negre-Salvayre A, et al. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153:6-20). But the most prominent products of PUFAs oxidation are alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes 4-hydroxynon-2-enal (4-HNE; formed from n-6 PUFAs like LA or AA), 4-hydroxyhex-2-enal (4-HHE; formed from n-3 PUFAs like ALA or DHA), and corresponding ketoaldehydes (Esterfbauer H, et al. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1991; 11:81-128; Long E K, Picklo M J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2010; 49:1-8). These reactive carbonyls cross-link (bio)molecules through Michael addition or Schiff base formation pathways, and have been implicated in a large number of pathological processes, age-related and oxidative stress-related conditions and aging. Importantly, in some cases, PUFAs appear to oxidize at specific sites because methylene groups of 1,4-diene systems (the bis-allylic position) are substantially less stable to ROS, and to enzymes such as cyclogenases and lipoxygenases than allylic methylenes.

614,614,"There are many diseases that are oxidative stress-related, including, but not limited to, neurological diseases, diabetes, diseases associated with elevated concentration of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and AMD. While the exact aetiology of many such diseases requires further clarification, PUFAs oxidation, and consequent cross-linking or derivatisation with reactive carbonyls, often plays a prominent role. The role of oxidative stress in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is known to be quite prominent (Beatty S, et al. Survey Ophtalm. 2000; 45:115-134; (de Jong Paulus T V M Age-related macular degeneration. The New England journal of medicine 2006; 355(14): 1474-85.); Wu J, Seregard S, et al. Survey Ophtalm. 2006; 51:461-481). Almost all major neurological diseases are known to be linked to oxidative stress. For instance, oxidized membrane components accelerate beta- and alpha-synuclein aggregation, associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) and synucleinopathies, by covalent and noncovalent mechanisms, respectively. Reactive products of PUFA peroxidation can trigger protein misfolding in sporadic amyloid diseases, which are the clinically most important neurological brain diseases (Bieschke J. et al, Acc. Chem. Res. 2006; 39:611-619).

617,617,"Increased oxygen levels, exposure to light and high PUFA content lead to increased PUFA peroxidation in the eye tissues. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of AMD (Beatty S, et al. Survey Ophtalm. 2000; 45:115-134). Increased levels of PUFA peroxidation products such as HNE and HHE have been reported in retina (Long E K, et al. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2010; 49:1-8). PUFA peroxidation products play a major role in formation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) lipofuscin, which itself can generate ROS upon irradiation with visible light, and plays a major role in etiology of AMD (Katz M L, Arch. Gerontol. Geriatr. 2002; 34:359-370). PUFA peroxidation products, including MDA, play such a prominent role in lens pathologies including formation of cataracts, that the PUFA peroxidation was proclaimed to be an initiating step in the human cataract pathogenesis (Borchman D. et al, J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51:2473-2488). Equally important is the role of PUFA peroxidation products in pathophysiology of diseases of human cornea, including pterygium and keratoconus (Shoham A, et al. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2008; 45:1047-1055). Diabetic retinopathy is also associated with oxidative stress and PUFA peroxidation (Baynes J W, Thorpe S R. Diabetes 1999; 48:1-9).

620,620,"See Cooper J L. Drugs & Aging 2003; 20:399-418. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the neuropathological hallmarks of AD, although whether they are the cause or the product of the disease is still debatable. Oxidative stress, and a related inflammation, is implicated in the AD process. The direct evidence supporting increased oxidative stress in AD is: (1) increased ROS-stimulating Fe, Al, and Hg in AD brain; (2) increased PUFA peroxidation and decreased PUFAs in the AD brain, and increased 4-HNE in AD ventricular fluid; (3) increased protein and DNA oxidation in the AD brain; (4) diminished energy metabolism and decreased cytochrome c oxidase in the brain in AD; (5) advanced glycation end products (AGE), MDA, carbonyls, peroxynitrite, heme oxygenase-1 and SOD-1 in neurofibrillary tangles and AGE, heme oxygenase-1, SOD-1 in senile plaques; and (6) studies showing that amyloid beta peptide is capable of generating ROS (Markesbery W R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1997; 23:134-147).
",0,US10052299-20180821.txt,0
621,621,"The abnormalities of lipid metabolism play a prominent role in AD. All proteins involved in Amyloid precursor protein processing and Ab peptide production are integral membrane proteins. Moreover, the Ab producing c-secretase cleavage takes place in the middle of the membrane, so the lipid environment of the cleavage enzymes influences Ab production and AD pathogenesis (Hartmann T. et al, J. Neurochem. 2007; 103:159-170). Lipid peroxidation is marked by high levels of malondialdehyde, isoprostanes, and high level of protein modification by HNE and acrolein (Sayre L M, et al. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2008; 21:172-188; Butterfield D A, et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2010; 1801:924-929). Dietary PUFAs are the principal risk factor for the development of late-onset sporadic AD. The degree of saturation of PUFAs and the position of the first double bond are the most critical factors determining the risk of AD, with unsaturated fats and n-3 double bonds conferring protection and an overabundance of saturated fats or n-6 double bonds increasing the risk. DHA and AA are particularly relevant to AD (Luzon-Toro B, et al. Neurol. Psychiatr. Brain Res. 2004; 11:149-160). DHA is the major component of excitable membranes, promotes maturation in infants and is a potent neuroprotective agent in the adult brain, with a potential role in the prevention of AD. AA is an important provider of eicosanoids, acting as a second messenger in many neurotransmitter systems. The interaction of dietary PUFAs and apolipoprotein E isoforms may determine the risk and rate of sustained autoperoxidation within cellular membranes and the efficacy of membrane repair.

622,622,"It has been reported that lipid peroxidation is present in the brain of MCI patients. Several studies established oxidative damage as an early event in the pathogenesis of AD, that can serve as a therapeutic target to slow the progression or perhaps the onset of the disease. (Markesbery W R. Arch. Neurol. 2007; 64:954-956). MCI can also be characterized by elevated levels of conjugates formed by lipid peroxidation products such as MDA, HNE, acrolein and isoprostanes (Butterfield D A, et al. Biochim. Biophys.

The etiology of most ALS cases remains unknown; however, it is recognized that ALS is strongly associated with oxidative stress. Familial ALS (fALS) is caused by oxidation of mutated SOD (superoxide dismutase) (Kabashi E. et al, Ann. Neurol. 2007; 62:553-559). There are more than 100 mutations in SOD that are associated with the fALS (Barnham K J et al, Nature Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3:205-214). The first step is the ‘monomerisation’ of SOD, which then leads to the aggregation of SOD monomers, which then form aberrant S—S bonds between themselves (Kabashi E. et al, Ann. Neurol. 2007; 62:553-559), yielding conglomerates which are toxic (either because they mis-fold and clog things up, or both (Barnham K J et al, Nature Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3:205-214).

Protein oxidation is increased 85% in sALS patients in one study (Coyle J T. et al, Science 1993; 262:689-695). And both increased lipid peroxidation and HNE formation were reported for ALS cases, both familial and sporadic (Simpson E P et al, Neurology 2004; 62:1758-1765), in the central nervous system (CNS) tissue, spinal fluid, and serum. The source of the oxidative stress in ALS is not clear but may derive from several processes including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, iron accumulation or immune activation (Simpson E P et al, Neurology 2004; 62:1758-1765). There is evidence that mitochondria play an important role in fALS and sALS, being both a trigger and a target for oxidative stress in ALS (Bacman S R et al, Molec. Neurobiol. 2006; 33:113-131). Inhibition of COX-2 has been reported to reduce spinal neurodegeneration and prolong the survival of ALS transgenic mice (Minghetti L. J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 2004; 63:901-910), highlighting the role for PUFA oxidation products in the etiology of ALS. There is also evidence of increased HHE-protein conjugation in ALS patients (Long E K, Picklo M J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2010; 49:1-8).

Chromosome 21 codes for Cu/Zn SOD and amyloid beta-peptide, so the DS is characterised by the overflow of these gene products and metabolites, notably an increased ratio of SOD to catalase, accompanied by excessive H 2 O 2 (Sinet P M.

639,639,"PD is associated with oxidative stress caused by ROS, which contributes to a cascade leading to dopamine cell degeneration in PD. However, oxidative stress is intimately linked to other components of disease and degenerative processes, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, nitric oxide toxicity and inflammation. Formation of intracellular toxic lipid peroxides has been directly linked to damage in nigral neurons through activation of toxic cellular cascades. Oxidative damage associated with PD is initiated at the PUFAs level, and then passed on to proteins and nuclear DNA and mtDNA (for example, in synuclein processing/Lewy body formation), and toxic carbonyl products of oxidative damage, such as HNE and MDA, can further react with proteins to impair cell viability. Nitric oxide is known to react with superoxide to produce peroxynitrite and ultimately hydroxyl radical. Altered degradation of proteins has been implicated as key to dopaminergic cell death in PD. Oxidative stress can impair these processes directly, and products of oxidative damage, such as HNE, can damage the 26S proteasome. HNE has been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of PD (Selley M L. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1998; 25:169-174; Zimniak P, Ageing Res. Rev. 2008; 7:281-300). Furthermore, impairment of proteasomal function leads to free radical generation and oxidative stress (Jenner P. Annals Neurol. 2003; 53: S26-S36). An additional source of ROS relevant to PD etiology is dopamine (DA) turnover in dopaminergic neurons (Hastings T G, J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2009; 41:469-72). Oxidative damage to nucleic acids, mediated through PUFA peroxidation products, also contributes to etiology of PD (Martin L J, J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2008; 67:377-87; Nakabeppu Y. et al., J.

Although the molecular mechanism of this synaptotoxicity is not known, published evidence suggests that these diseases are characterized by a common pathophysiological cascade involving oxidative stress, PUFA peroxidation ( FIG. 1 ) and the subsequent liberation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives such as acrolein and 4-HNE.

Some drawbacks of such an approach include (but are not limited to) the following points, relevant to both small molecule and enzymatic antioxidants: (a) the near-saturating amount of antioxidants already present in living cells means that any further increase, even if substantial, in the amount of antioxidants would have only incremental, if any, effect on the residual ROS levels (Zimniak P, Ageing Res.

In a further embodiment, such pro-bis-allylic sites, in addition to existing bis-allylic sites are reinforced by isotope substitution as shown below. Accordingly, this aspect of the invention provides for the use of compounds of Formula (2), where at each bis-allylic position, and at each pro-bis-allylic position, both X or both Y atoms may be deuterium atoms.

667,667,"Oxidation of PUFAs at different bis-allylic sites gives rise to different sets of products upon enzymatic- or ROS-driven oxidation. For example, 4-HNE is formed from n-6 PUFAs whereas 4-HHE is formed from n-3 PUFAs (Negre-Salvayre A, et al. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153:6-20). The products of such oxidation possess different regulatory, toxic, signalling, etc. properties. It is therefore desirable to control the relative extent of such oxidations. Accordingly, some aspects of the invention provide for the use of compounds of Formula (3), differentially reinforced with heavy stable isotopes at selected bis-allylic or pro-bis-allylic positions, to control the relative yield of oxidation at different sites, as shown below, such that any of the pairs of Y 1 -Y n and/or X 1 -X m at the bis-allylic or pro-bis-allylic positions of PUFAs are Deuterium atoms.

In some embodiments, is preferable to have sufficient isotopically modified PUFAs such as D-PUFAs in the membrane to prevent unmodified PUFAs such as H-PUFAs from sustaining a chain reaction of self-oxidation. During self-oxidation, when one PUFA oxidises, and there is a non-oxidised PUFA in the vicinity, the non-oxidised PUFA can get oxidised by the oxidised PUFA. This may also be referred to as autooxidation. In some instances, if there is a low concentration, for example “dilute” H-PUFAs in the membrane with D-PUFAs, this oxidation cycle may be broken due to the distance separating H-PUFAs. In some embodiments, the concentration of isotopically modified PUFAs is present in a sufficient amount to maintain autooxidation chain reaction. To break the autooxidation chain reaction, for example, 1-60%, 5-50%, or 15-35% of the total molecules of the same type are in the membrane.

735,735,"Characteristic areas of 1 H and 13 C spectra, all values in ppm. (Panel A) Deuteration of Lin acid at pos. 11 is confirmed by the disappearance of peaks in 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra. Disappearance of the peak at δ H 2.764 is expected due to absence of H atoms NMR). Disappearance of the peak at δ C 25.5 in is due to combination of Nuclear Overhauser Effect, and splitting of this particular carbon atom into a quintet by two D atoms in the deuterated form of Lin acid. (Panel B) The 1 H NMR spectrum shows that the H atoms at C11 and C14 positions of site-specifically deuterated αLnn coincide (δ H 2.801) thus deuteration at either site (11,11-H 2 , 14,14-D 2 or 11,11-D 2 , 14,14-H 2 ) leads to a 50% decrease in integration of this peak, while deuteration of both sites (11,11,14,14-D 4 ) leads to the complete disappearance of the peak at δ H 2.801. However, 13 C NMR experiments can clearly distinguish between the three deuterated forms, as the observed peaks for C11 and C14 positions are separated by a small but detectable difference. Thus, the deuteration at either C11 or C14 positions leads to disappearance of the peak at δ C 25.68 or δ C 25.60, respectively, while the deuteration at both sites leads to disappearance of the two corresponding peaks.

737,737,"Q-less yeast (coq mutants) provide an ideal system to assess in vivo autoxidation of fatty acids. Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone or Q) serves as a small lipophilic antioxidant as well as an electron shuttle in the respiratory chain of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Ten S. cerevisiae genes (COQ1-COQ10) are required for coenzyme Q biosynthesis and function, and the deletion of any results in respiratory deficiency (Tran U C, Clarke C F. Mitochondrion 2007; 7S, S62). It was shown that the coq yeast mutants are exquisitely sensitive to autoxidation products of PUFAs (Do T Q et al, PNAS USA 1996; 93:7534-7539; Poon W W, Do T Q, Marbois B N, Clarke C F. Mol. Aspects. Med. 1997; 18, s121). Although S. cerevisiae do not produce PUFAs (Paltauf F, Daum G. Meth. Enzymol. 1992; 209:514-522), they are able to utilize PUFAs when provided exogenously, allowing their content to be manipulated (Paltauf F, Daum G. Meth. Enzymol. 1992; 209:514-522). Less than 1% of Q-less (coq2, coq3, and coq5) yeast mutants is viable following a four hour treatment with linolenic acid (Do T Q et al, PNAS USA 1996; 93:7534-7539; Poon W W, Do T Q, Marbois B N, Clarke C F. Mol. Aspects. Med. 1997; 18,s121). In contrast, 70% of wild-type (the parental genetic background is strain W303-1B) cells subjected to this treatment remain viable. The Q-less yeast are also hypersensitive to other PUFAs that readily autoxidize (such as arachidonic acid), but behave the same as the wild-type parental strain to treatment with the monounsaturated oleic acid (Do T Q et al, PNAS USA 1996; 93:7534-7539). The hypersensitivity of the Q-less yeast mutants is not a secondary effect of the inability to respire, because cor1 or atp2 mutant yeast (lacking either the bc1 complex or the ATP synthase, respectively) show wild-type resistance to PUFA treatment (Do T Q et al, PNAS USA 1996; 93:7534-7539; Poon W W, Do T Q, Marbois B N, Clarke C F.

In stark contrast, coq mutants treated with the D4-linolenic acid were not killed, and retained viabilities similar to yeast treated with oleic acid. Quantitative colony counting revealed that the viability of cells treated with oleic and D4-linolenic was similar ( FIG. 4 ), while the viability of the coq mutants was reduced more than 100-fold following treatment with the standard linolenic acid for 4 h. These results indicate that isotope-reinforced linolenic acid is much more resistant to autoxidation than is the standard linolenic acid, as evidenced by the resistance of the hypersensitive coq mutants to cell killing.

741,741,"Therefore, it seems likely that yeast would also incorporate exogenously supplied D4-linolenic acid. However, it is possible that the differential sensitivity to linolenic and D4-linolenic might be attributed to differences in integration into the cell rather than autoxidation. To test whether this is the case, the extent of uptake of this fatty acid was monitored. First the conditions of separation of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of C18:1, C18:3, D4-18:3 and C17:0 (to be used as an internal standard) were determined. The GC-MS chromatogram shown in FIG. 5 establishes both separation and sensitivity of detection of these fatty acid methyl ester standards.

Cells were harvested, washed twice with 10 ml sterile water, and the yeast cell pellets were then processed by alkaline methanolysis as described above. The fatty acids are detected as methylesters (FAMEs) following GC-MS with C17:0 added as an internal standard ( FIG. 6 ). The amounts of 18:3 and D4 detected after 4 h incubation were extrapolated from the calibration curve. These results indicate yeast avidly incorporate both linolenic and D4-linolenic acid during the 4 h incubation period. Based on these results, it is obvious that the enhanced resistance of the coq mutant yeast to treatment with D4-C18:3 is not due to lack of uptake.

748,748,"When delivering D2-LA and D4-ALA through dietary supplementation, incorporation into animal tissues cannot be monitored by chromatography based analytical techniques because said PUFAs can be further extended/desaturated in mammals, thus changing their chemical identity. We used an isotope ratio mass-spectrometry technique which allows for measurement of the total increase in deuterium composition in lipid membranes, thus reporting on incorporation of D2-LA, D4-ALA, and any other PUFA derived from these two. Using this method, a substantial uptake of D-PUFA into mouse brain tissue was detected. Mice were supplemented with D-PUFA or H-PUFA as the only PUFA source for 6 days, exposed acutely to 40 mg/kg MPTP ((1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) or saline vehicle and continued on the same diet for an additional 6 days. MPTP is a well-recognized model in mice of Parkinson's disease. Brains were removed and dissected, and homogenate samples from saline-treated mice were analyzed for deuterium content.

",0,US09687556-20170627.txt,0
792,792,"Protein pathology is a common denominator in the etiology or pathogenesis of many medical disorders, ranging from malfunction of a mutated protein, to pathological gain of function where a specific protein acquires a novel property, which renders it toxic. Conceptually, inhibition of the synthesis of these of proteins by gene therapy may hold promise for patients having such protein anomaly.

793,793,"One of the major advances of recent years is the concept of silencing a specific gene by RNA interference, using small interfering RNA (siRNA). RNA interference is based on short (≈19-27 base pairs), double-stranded RNA sequences (designated siRNA), capable of acting, in concert with cellular biological systems [among others, the Dicer protein complex which cleaves double-stranded RNA to produce siRNA, and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)], to inhibit translation and mark for degradation specific mRNA sequences, thus inhibiting gene expression at the translational stage. The use of antisense oligonucoleotide (ASO), being a short sequence (usually 13-25 nucleotides) of unmodified or chemically modified DNA molecules, complementary to a specific messenger RNA (mRNA), has also been used to inhibit the expression and block the production of a specific target protein.
",0,US09687556-20170627.txt,0
794,794,"However, albeit the tremendous potential benefits of such approaches for medical care, delivery of such macromolecules into cells remains a substantial challenge, due to the relatively large and highly-charged structures of oligonucleotides (for example, siRNA has an average molecular weight of 13 kD, and it carries about 40 negatively-charged phosphate groups). Therefore, trans-membrane delivery of oliogonucleotides requires overcoming a very large energetic barrier.

795,795,"The membrane dipole potential is an electric potential that exists within any phospholipid membrane, between the water/membrane interface and the membrane center (positive inside). It is assumed to be generated by the highly ordered carbonyl groups of the phospholipid glyceryl esteric bonds, and its amplitude is about 220-280 mV. Since the membrane dipole potential resides in a highly hydrophobic environment of dielectric constant of 2-4, it translates into a very strong electric field of 10 8 -10 9 V/m. Conceivably, the membrane dipole potential and related intra-membrane electric field are highly important for the function of membrane proteins, determining the conformation and activity of membrane proteins. However, to the best of our knowledge, to date, the dipole potential has not been recruited for drug development.

796,796,"Various methods have been developed for delivery of macromolecules such as oligonucleotides or proteins across biological membranes. These methods include viral vectors, as well as non-viral delivery systems, such as cationic lipids or liposomes. However to date, use of these methods has been largely limited to applications in vitro, or to focal administration in vivo, for example, by direct injection into the eye or direct administration into the lung. Efficient delivery has also been achieved to the liver. Among these methods, electroporation is an effective and widely-used method for delivery of macromolecules in vitro. According to this method, an external electric field is applied to a cell suspension, leading to collision of charged target molecules with the cell membrane, subsequent temporary and focal membrane destabilization, and consequent passage of the macromolecules into the cell. However, as described above, electroporation is mainly used in vitro. Electroporation in vivo encounters limited success, and was attempted only to specific organs (e.g., muscle, lung), where external electrodes could be inserted into the target organ.

",0,US09687556-20170627.txt,0
822,822,"Embodiments of the present invention relate to novel Conjugates, comprising a delivery system for drugs across biological membranes into the cytoplasm, or through biological barriers, such as, the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), the blood-ocular barrier (BOB), or the blood-fetal-barrier (placental-blood-barrier). Compounds according to embodiments of the invention comprise novel, rationally-designed “Molecular NanoMotors (MNMs)”, rationally-designed to move within phospholipid membranes, from the membrane/water interface to the membrane core, utilizing the internal membrane electric field, generated by the membrane dipole potential. When attached to a drug, the delivery system acts to re-locate the drug towards the membrane center, thus assisting in its trans-membrane movement. Among others, this delivery system is designed for the delivery of therapeutic macromolecules: proteins or oligonucleotides, the latter being single or double-stranded DNA or RNA. Among others, the delivery system is designed for the delivery of antisense oligonuclotides (ASO), siRNA or therapeutic proteins, such as, for example without limitation, the Cas9 protein or antibodies.
",0,US09687556-20170627.txt,0
823,823,"Proposed in a non-limiting manner, one of the principles underlying the structures of MNMs according to embodiments of the invention is the principle of “asymmetrical polarity”. This principle relates to hydrophobic, uncharged molecules, that according to their log P are capable of partitioning into biological membranes, [for example without limitation, having a log P value>1 (see FIG. 1 A)]. In addition, these molecules are polar, and have their partial charges distributed in an uneven manner: the partial negative charge is highly focused and localized, while the partial positive charge is dispersed along hydrocarbon chains within the molecule. Furthermore, upon interaction with the phospholipid membrane, the partial positive charge is also masked, through London type hydrophobic interactions, taking place between hydrocarbon chains of the molecule and adjacent hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipid milieu (London dispersion forces). Consequently, as schematically illustrated in FIG. 1A , the molecules of the invention are capable of moving in the membrane milieu. Since the internal membrane electric field has a negative pole at the membrane/water interface, and a positive pole at the membrane center, the molecules of the invention move toward the membrane center, and when attached to a cargo (e.g., a drug such as siRNA, ASO, a therapeutic protein or another medicament), the cargo is re-located onto the membrane center. This movement may facilitate the trans-membrane movement of the cargo molecule in several ways. Among others, it may enforce proximity of a charged macro-molecule to the phospholipid headgroups (PLHG), perturb the hydration shells around the PLHG, and thus force lateral movement of the PLHG. Formation of transient pores within the membrane may then takes place, with passage of the cargo drug through these pores into the cell. Subsequent spontaneous closure of these transient pores may then take place, thus sealing the membrane pore, with membrane healing ( FIG. 2 ).
",0,US09687556-20170627.txt,0
824,824,"The Conjugates of the invention may also comprise a cleavable group (e.g., a disulfide group, or an oligonucleotide sequence cleavable by the Dicer enzyme) ( FIG. 1b , or FIG. 3 ). Cleavage of a Conjugate of the invention at these sites may act to trap the cargo drug (e.g., highly negatively-charged siRNA or ASO, or other medicament) in the cytoplasm of the target cell. In addition, the continuous consumption of the Conjugate due to its cleavage may also assist in maintaining a concentration gradient of the Conjugate across the cell membrane. The term “cleavable group” in the context of the present invention, therefore relates to a chemical moiety, capable of undergoing spontaneous or enzyme-mediated cleavage in certain physiological conditions, such as changes in pH, changes in red-ox state, or other conditions within cells. Examples for cleavable groups are ester, thio-ester, amide, carbamate, disulfide, ether, a pH-sensitive moiety, a redox-sensitive moiety, or a metal chelator [which thereby includes its chelated metal ion(s)]. Conceptually, a cleavable group may assist in entrapment of a drug within a target cell following its trans-membrane passage, or assist in maintaining a concentration gradient of the Conjugate of the invention) across the biological membranes.

825,825,"For example, in the case of a Conjugate according to an embodiment of the invention, that comprises siRNA, ASO or a therapeutic protein as pharmaceutically-active drugs, and a disulfide group as a cleavable group, once inside the cytoplasm, the prevailing ambient reductive environment will act to reduce the disulfide bond to free thiol groups, thus cleaving the Conjugate, and leading to disengagement of the MNMs from the cargo drug. Devoid of the MNM, the charged cargo macromolecule will eventually be captured in the cytoplasm, where for example, in the case of siRNA, it will be ready for interaction with the Diver enzyme, or the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), resulting in silencing of the expression of a specific gene.

831,831,"The field of Protein Drugs for Intracellular Targets (PDIT) is a relatively novel field, derived, in part, from the completion of the Human Genome Sequencing Project, which allows identification of a huge number of novel intracellular targets for potential medical interventions, through administration of protein drugs, gene silencing, RNA or DNA editing, or protein replacement therapy. Conceptually, such therapeutic strategies can be useful for treatment of almost any medical disorder. Specific, highly attractive candidate proteins within the PDIT field are the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-related proteins, and specifically, the Cas9 Protein. This recently-discovered protein is initially a bacterial protein, naturally-used by bacteria as for an anti-viral agent. Practically, Cas9 can be loaded by any RNA sequence, entailing specificity in directing the protein specifically to any locus within the genome, rationally-selected according to its potential relation to a mutated, defective gene. Cas9 then induces an accurate double-strand cut of the DNA. Naturally-occurring DNA repair mechanisms may then be subsequently recruited, to repair said DNA locus within the malfunctioning gene. Therefore, Cas9 and related proteins enable highly effective gene editing (adding, disrupting or changing the sequence of specific genes) and gene regulation and repair, applicable to species throughout the tree of life. By delivering Cas9 protein and an appropriate guide RNA into a cell, the organism's genome can therefore be cut at any desired location, and be subjected to editing and repair.

848,848,"As described above in a non-limiting potential Mechanism Of Action (MOA), Conjugates according to embodiments of the invention, comprising a drug such as siRNA or a therapeutic protein, conjugated to MNM(s), undergo trans-membrane delivery when interacting with a phospholipid membrane. This mechanism of action is schematically summarized in FIG. 2 . Due to the principle of asymmetrical polarity, described in FIGS. 1a and 2 , initially, the MNMs move from the membrane surface to the membrane core, energized by the internal membrane electric field (i). As the second stage [ FIG. 2 (ii)], the macromolecule, linked to the MNMs, is forced to approach the membrane surface, thus perturbing the hydration shells of both the cargo macromolecule drug and the phospholipid head-groups. Consequently, there is lateral movement of the phospholipid head-groups, and formation of transient membrane pores, through which the macromolecule drug is delivered into the cell. Subsequent closure of the transient pore then takes place with membrane healing [ FIG. 2 (iii)].

849,849,"In an example, schematically presented in FIG. 1B , the Conjugate of the invention comprises a cargo drug (moiety D), being siRNA, ASO or a therapeutic protein, and a disulfide group, for entrapment of the cargo drug in the cytoplasm, due to the ambient reductive environment.
",0,US09687556-20170627.txt,0
850,850,"In another embodiment of the invention, entrapment of siRNA in the cytoplasm may be achieved through the administration of a Conjugate, where D is a double-stranded RNA, which is a Dicer substrate, namely, comprising 23-30 nucleotides, selected according to the genetic code suitable for silencing a specific target gene. One or several MNMs may then be linked to such oligonuclotide drug. Preferably, MNMs are attached at the 3′-end and/or the 5′-end of the sense (“passenger”) strand, and/or at the 5′-end of the antisense (“guide”) strand. Upon administration of the Conjugate, the MNMs will enable the trans-membrane delivery of the macro-molecule drug. Subsequent cleavage of the dsRNA by the Dicer enzyme in the cytoplasm will then remove the MNM(s) at the 3′-end of the passenger strand, and/or at the 5′-end of the guide stand, thus releasing the siRNA. The siRNA, due to its numerous negative charges, is eventually entrapped in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with the RISC complex, resulting in silencing of the target gene. This, Dicer-mediated mechanism of intracellular entrapment is schematically illustrated in FIG. 3 .
",0,US09687556-20170627.txt,0
851,851,"In yet another mechanism, entrapment of siRNA or ASO within the cytoplasm can be achieved in the case that E, E′ or E″ comprises a Q moiety, being a chelator for calcium ion(s), bound via coordinative bonds to phosphate groups of the oligonucleotide drug. Such binding can be mediated, for example, by Ca +2 ions. Such Conjugates may be stable in the plasma, due to the relatively high ambient Ca +2 levels (about 1 mM). Moreover, due to the MNMs, the Conjugates will manifest trans-membrane delivery into the cells. Once inside the cytoplasm, the low cytoplasmatic Ca +2 levels will induce de-complexation, releasing the cargo oligonucleotide, which will then interact with its target sites, such as the Dicer or the RISC complex, for gene silencing.
