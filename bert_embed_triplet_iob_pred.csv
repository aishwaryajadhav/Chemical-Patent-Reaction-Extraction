3,"Glutamate which is the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals plays an important role in maintaining the normal function of nervous system and also plays an important role in many pathophysiological processes such as pain, neurodegenerative lesions and epilepsy. At the same time, the massive release and accumulation of glutamate in the nervous system is the pathology basis of a variety of nerve cell damage and neurodegenerative disease, i.e., the neurotoxic effect of glutamate, eventually leading to neuronal death. The excitotoxicity lead by glutamate activating its receptor and the oxidative toxicity lead by inhibiting of glutamate / cystine transporters on the cell membrane are the origins of many nervous system diseases such as cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, thus making glutamate receptors become one of the therapeutic targets of these diseases.

4,"Glutamate receptors (GluR) are mainly divided into ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist has achieved some therapeutic effect in the animal model by directly blocking the postsynaptic effect of glutamate, but it also blocks normal excitatory transmission and produces serious side effects, such as psychiatric symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, etc., thus limiting the clinical application of such compounds; and metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibit the release of glutamate through the presynaptic mechanism, thus reducing the toxic and side effect of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, and are expected to become a new target for the treatment of certain neurological diseases.
",0,EP3284738A1.txt,0
5,"mGluRs is one of the members of the C family of the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily. According to its protein sequence homology, receptor-coupled second messenger system signal transduction mechanism and specificity for different agonists, it can be divided into three categories. The first category mGluRI (mGluR1, mGluR5) mainly is distributed in the postsynaptic region, the mGluR1 receptors are also distributed in the glial cells, and the mGluR5 receptors are distributed in the marginal cortex and basal ganglia, which are closely related to the morphology of dendritic spines and play an important role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. The second category mGluR II (mGluR2, mGluR3) mainly locates in the presynaptic region, wherein mGluR2 receptors locate in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, thalamus synaptic axons, mGluR3 receptors are also widely distributed in the brain, including glia. The third category mGluRIII (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, mGluR8) is also distributed in the presynaptic region, mGluR 4/7/8 locates in the basal ganglia movement loop, and mGluR6 receptors are in the retinal neurons. There is about 70% homology in the same mGluR group, and only about 45% homology between the different groups. mGluR5 mainly locates in the neuronal postsynaptic excitatory terminal and glia, couples with Gα/q protein, activates phospholipase C, and enhances intracellular Ca2+ release. Studies have shown that mGluR5 is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), mainly in the areas associated with the nervous system and mental illness such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia, etc.. Thus, mGluR5 is one of the important targets for the treatment of central nervous system and psychiatric-related diseases.

6,"Regarding to the design of medicine to the target, early studies mainly focused on the design of small molecule competitive antagonists for endogenous ligands, but because of the high conservation degree of the mGlu receptor binding sites, it is difficult to obtain a compound having good selectivity to receptor subtypes. In addition, many endogenous ligands are often glutamic acid derivatives, lacking suitable pharmacokinetic properties and CNS permeability makes these compounds difficult to use in clinical research. In recent years, allosteric modulators of mGlu receptors have attracted widespread attention. Compounds bind to non-endogenous ligand sites, do not directly activate or antagonize receptor function, but indirectly increase or decrease glutamate-induced activity, known as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs). mGlu receptor allosteric modulators act on the allosteric sites of the GPCR transmembrane region, thus providing greater possibilities for overcoming defects in the selectivity and poor permeability of the mGlu receptor endogenous site competitive antagonists.

7,"In recent years, mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator has caused great concern of the majority of scientific research workers and major pharmaceutical companies as a potential treatment drug for fragile X chromosome syndrome, such as Parkinson's disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia (PD-LID), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), autism, pain, anxiety, depression, drug addiction and the like. Since 2000, there have been more than 190 mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator patent applications, of which 66 patent applications are filed from 2009 to June 2013; so far at least 9 small molecules have entered the clinical trials, of which 4 compounds are currently undergoing II or III clinical trials such as Mavoglurant, Diproglurant, RG7090 and Fenobam. Therefore, mGluR5 negative allosteric regulatory site is regarded as ideal drug target, while designing novel mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator for the treatment of the central nervous system and psychiatric system-related diseases on this basis has very important significance and good application prospects.

47,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), also known as Martin-Bell syndrome, is a common hereditary mental retardation disease. The incidence is about 1/1250 in male and 1/2500 in female. It accounts for 2% -6% of non-specific mental retardation, and 40% of X-associated mental retardation. The clinical symptoms are various degrees of mental retardation, attention deficit, hyperactivity, anxiety with mood swings, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, and can also occur poor coordination of exercise and increased prevalence of epilepsy, as well as other non-neurological symptoms such as unusual face, large ears, excessive joint extension and postpubescent hyperorchidism. The virulence gene-FMR1 was successfully cloned by Verkerk, et al. (1991). The abnormal amplification of (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat sequence at the 5' end of the gene and the abnormal methylation of adjacent site CpG island lead to the transcription and translation termination of FMR1 gene, resulting in the reduction or deletion of the encoded product FMRP, i.e. fragile X mental retardation protein. The emergence of FMR1 knockout mice in 1994 was a milestone in the study of fragile X syndrome. Bakker et al. inserted a neomycin fragment in the FMR1 gene region, thus preventing the gene to express FMRP to produce a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Many behavioral manifestations of FMR1 knockout mice are very similar to those of fragile X syndrome patients, most notably including the increase in spontaneous activity, the decreased open field habit ability, the increase of susceptibility of the audiogenic seizures, and the slight lack of learning ability.

48,"For the fragile X chromosome syndrome, there are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of fragile X chromosome syndrome, while the existing treatment such as special education, behavioral therapy, social skills training and drug treatment can improve the prognosis of some affected individuals, and improve the secondary symptoms, but can not effectively solve the the core defects of fragile X chromosome syndrome. Currently, commonly used drugs are mainly large doses of folic acid (which can improve patient's behavior and exercise ability, language quality, but can not improve intelligence obviously, and has no effect for adult patients), antidepressants, central nervous system stimulants (methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, etc., which is effective for improving the lack of attention and excessive activity, but of great side effects) and anti-manic drugs (thioridazine, for the treatment of behavioral and emotional disorders).
",0,EP3284738A1.txt,0
49,"Fragile X syndrome is caused by the mutation of a single gene FMR1. The FMR1 gene mutation will hinder the expression of protein FMRP, thus leading to the brain FMRP deletion. In normal circumstances, FMRP protein can control or block the mGluR5 activated signaling pathway in brain cells. When FMRP is absent, mGluR5 signal is overactivated, thus causing abnormalities in brain neurons relation and behavior and cognitive impairment associated with fragile X syndrome. The abnormalities of dendritic spine induced by fragile X syndrome may be due to the over-activation of mGluR-I pathway induced by FMRP deletion, which affects intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and protein synthesis. In the experiment, it was observed that when the FMR1 gene knockout mice cultured hippocampal neurons were given mGluRI inhibitor PHCCC, the content of microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) was significantly lower than that of untreated KO mice, thus confirming that the inhibitor could interfere with mGluR-I activation induced protein synthesis. It was also observed that the dendritic spine in the KO mouse inhibitory group was shorter than that in the untreated group, indicating that the inhibitor could partially reverse the dendritic spine morphological abnormality of the fragile X syndrome. This indicated that the mGluR-I inhibitor was able to partially replace the FMRP negative regulation function, thus affecting the function of these proteins. A number of studies have also shown that by specifically inhibiting mGluR5, the symptoms of FXS patients can be significantly improved, thus of good safety and less side effects. Therefore, mGluR5 negative allosteric regulatory site is regarded as ideal drug target for fragile X chromosome, while designing novel mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator for the treatment of such diseases on this basis has very important significance and good application prospects.

In addition to erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, it also causes chronic cough, chronic laryngitis, bronchial asthma, tooth erosion and other extraesophageal manifestations.

51,"At present, the main drug for clinical treatment of GERD is proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but there are PPI-resistant patients whose symptoms are not necessarily related to acid. Also, it often leads to recurrence of patients after drug discontinuance, and long-term use also leads to patients adverse reactions. And most of other drugs such as H2 receptor inhibitors, prokinetic agent, visceral pain regulators, antacids, etc. are only effective to mild patients, which limits its clinical application. The traditional treatment drugs can only relieve symptoms to a certain extent, and can not achieve the therapeutic effect for the pathogenesis.

52,"Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR) abnormality is one of the main pathogenesis of GERD. Studies have shown that about 90% of reflux in GERD patients is associated with TLESR. Glutamate can convey the sensory information in the intestine to the central nervous system, including the vagal signal that triggers TLESR. Studies have shown that selective mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators can effectively inhibit TLESR, reduce the number of patients reflux, and extend the interval of reflux.

54,"Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as tremor paralysis, is the second major central nervous system degenerative diseases after Alzheimer's disease, the main clinical symptoms are exercise retardation, resting tremor, muscle stiffness, gait and posture abnormalities. The widespread use of levodopa has resulted in a more satisfactory control of Parkinson's symptoms, but most patients experience levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) after long-term use (more than five years). LID are often expressed as dance-like movements, dystonia, athetosis, or simple repetitive involuntary movements, the severity often associated with the degree of degenerative lesions of dopaminergic neurons.
",0,EP3284738A1.txt,0
55,"In PD, since the inhibitory effect of D2 receptor on the striatum-globus pallidus neurons is attenuated, and the glutamate conduction activity of the indirect pathway is significantly enhanced, therefore, reducing the activity of the indirect pathway is the main goal of PD treatment, which can be achieved by inhibition of glutamate neurotransmission. Blocking glutamate receptor activity by the drug can reduce the introduction of glutamatergic neurons, block intrastriatal gene abnormal expression caused by levodopa, and weaken the LID. mGluR5 is highly expressed on the projection neurons of the striatum, but not in the target organ of the autonomic nervous system, which overcomes the adverse effects of the traditional drugs acting directly on the dopamine system. Studies have also shown that mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators can reduce the probability of LID in PD rats; and clinical drugs have also showed that mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators have good safety, tolerance and anti-exercise disorder effectivity.

The Fluo 8-AM fluorescent dye is an acetyl methyl ester derivative of Fluo 8 which can easily penetrate the cell membrane into the cell by culture. The fluorescent dye into the cell will be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase, the resulting Fluo 8 cannot easily pass through the lipid bimolecular membrane as a polar molecule, and will retain in the cell, and combine with calcium (Ca2+) to produce fluoresces.

413,"Cells expressing GPCR receptor protein (mGluR5) were first calibrated with a calcium ion sensitive fluorescent probe and then stimulated with the compound. After stimulation, the activation of the receptor lead to the calcium ion mobilization, and the fluorescent probe captures the calcium ion to induce the fluorescence signal. The signal can be read by a fluorescent plate reader. The fluorescent plate reader contains a sampling head for compound addition, thus enabling the change of the fluorescence value of the compound be read in real time. If the selected compound can activate mGluR5, the calcium flow reaction can be greatly increased; conversely, if the selected compound is able to antagonize mGluR5, the calcium flow reaction can be greatly reduced.

Brk is highly expressed in a lot of tumors including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, oral squamous cell cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, melanoma, B-cell lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoma. In particular, Brk is a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer, prostate cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer. In addition, it is thought that Brk plays important roles in tumorigenesis such as promotion of proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, and avoidance of cell death (see Non Patent Literatures 1 to 7).

1327,"BACKGROUND ART
",0,EP3323817A1.txt,0
1328,"EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), also known as HER1 or ErbB1, is a receptor for cell proliferation and signal transduction of the epithelial growth factor (EGF). EGFR belongs to a member of the ErbB receptor family which includes EGFR (ErbB-1), HER2/c-neu (ErbB-2), HER3 (ErbB-3) and HER4 (ErbB-4). EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 170KDa, which belongs to a tyrosine kinase receptor.
",0,EP3323817A1.txt,0
1329,"EGFR is located on the surface of cell membranes and is activated by binding to ligands including EGF and TGFα. Upon being activated, EGFR undergoes a transition from a monomer to a dimer. The dimer includes not only the binding of two identical receptor molecules (homodimerization) but also the binding of different members of the human EGF-associated receptor (HER) tyrosine kinase family (heterodimerization). EGFR can activate its intracellular kinase pathways after dimerization, resulting in the phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain and the stimulation to many intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival.
",0,EP3323817A1.txt,0
1330,"There exist high or abnormal expressions of EGFR in many solid tumors. EGFR is associated with tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, metastasis and the inhibition of apoptosis. Possible mechanisms include the followings: enhanced downstream signal transduction caused by the high expressions of EGFR; the sustained activation of EGFR caused by the increased expressions of mutant EGFR receptors or ligands; the enhanced effect of autocrine loops; the destruction of receptor downregulation mechanisms; and the activation of aberrant signaling pathways, etc. Overexpressions of EGFR play an important role in the progression of malignant tumors. For example, overexpressions of EGFR have been found in gliocyte, kidney cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and other tissues.
",0,EP3323817A1.txt,0
1331,"Aberrant expressions of EGFR and Erb-B2 play a crucial role in tumor transformation and growth. In the case of lung cancer, EGFR is expressed in 50% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and its expression is associated with poor prognosis. The two factors allow EGFR and its family members to be major candidates of targeted therapy. Two types of small molecule inhibitors targeted to EGFR, gefitinib and erlotinib, were rapidly approved by the FDA of USA for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients who have no response to traditional chemotherapy.
",0,EP3323817A1.txt,0
1332,"Early clinical data indicated that 10% of NSCLC patients have response to getifinib and erlotinib. Molecular biological analysis shows that in most cases, drug-responsive patients carry specific mutations in the EGFR-encoding genes: the deletion of amino acids at positions 747-750 in exon 19 accounts for 45% of mutations, and 10% of mutations occur in exons 18 and 20. The most common EGFR-activating mutations (L858R and delE746_A750) result in an increase in affinity for small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and a decrease in affinity for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) relative to wild type (WT) EGFR. T790M mutation is a point mutation in exon 20 of EGFR, which leads to acquired resistance to the treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. A recent study shows that the combination of L858R and T790M mutations has a stronger affinity for ATP than L858R alone, and TKIs are ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, and thereby resulting in a decreased binding rate between TKIs and kinase domains.

1663,"BACKGROUND
",0,EP3330263A1.txt,0
1664,"As the most important key enzyme in intracellular tricarboxylic acid cycle, IDH (full name: isocitrate dehydrogenase) can catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitric acid to 2-oxoglutarate (i.e., α-ketoglutaric acid). Researches have shown that many tumors (such as, glioma, sarcoma, and acute myelocytic leukemia) have an IDH mutation at arginine residue in a catalytic center (IDH1/R132H, IDH/R140Q, and IDH2/R172K). The mutated IDH acquires a new ability to catalyze the conversion of α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG). Researches have shown that the structure of α-ketoglutaric acid is similar to that of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, and 2-HG competes with α-KG, thereby reducing the activity of α-KG-dependent enzymes, and resulting in a high methylation of chromatin. Such supermethylation is considered to interfere with a normal cell differentiation, and lead to an excessive proliferation of immature cells, thereby resulting in cancers.

1665,"In 2013, Agios Pharmaceuticals reported an IDH2/R140Q inhibitor AGI-6780 (Science. 2013, 340, 622-626) and an IDH1/R132H inhibitor AGI-5198 (Science. 2013, 340, 626-630), and WO2015017821 disclosed another IDH2/R140Q inhibitor AG-221. AGI-6780 and AGI-5198 can inhibit the generation of 2-HG in cells carrying the most common IDH2 mutant and the most common IDH1 mutant, respectively. These molecules not only inhibit the generation of 2-HG, but also induce the differentiation of abnormally proliferated human cancer cells in a culture. The treatment of leukemia cells carrying the IDH2 mutant with AGI-6780, and the treatment of glioma cells carrying the IDH1 mutant with AGI-5198 both result in an enhanced expression of mature markers in these cells. Moreover, researchers have found that AGI-5198 can inhibit the growth rate of the glioma cells either by the treatment of cell cultures with AGI-5198 or by oral administration of AGI-5198 to mice with a transplanted tumour.

1969,"The human body maintains homeostasis by properly eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activity of the antioxidant system. However, when the balance between ROS generation and the activity of the antioxidant system is broken, oxidative stress increases, which has recently attracted attention as the primary common cause of development of aging, age-related degenerative diseases, such as degenerative arthritis, cataract, Alzheimer's disease and the like, various cancers, fibrotic diseases, and metabolic syndromes, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and the like. The ROS are unstable and highly reactive molecules that oxidize biological molecules to cause biochemical and physiological damage, which is one of the major mechanisms of aging. Thus, not only the degree of oxidation in the human body, but also the degree of antioxidation or antioxidant activity can be used as major biomarkers for measuring biological age.

In addition, the amount of stem cells obtained from tissue is very small, and these stem cells need to be used in large amounts, and hence culturing is performed in which the number of stem cells is increased. In recent years, as methods of managing the quality of stem cells by measuring the antioxidant activity of the stem cells, methods of measuring intracellular antioxidant activity have been disclosed (Korean Patent No. 10-1575846 ; Korean Patent Application Publication No. 2004-0030701 ; Hongyan Liu et al., Cytotherapy, 14(2); 162-172,2012 ).

This suggests that the tracer can be used as a radiometric sensor.

The position of the fluorescence measured by high-throughput cell imaging in HeLa cells loaded with the GolgiFreSH-tracer and the Golgi apparatus marker BODIPY TR C5-ceramide was examined, and as a result, it was could be observed that the F510 of the GolgiFreSH-tracer mostly overlapped with the fluorescence of BODIPY TR C5-ceramide, indicating that the GolgiFreSH-tracer was located in the Golgi apparatus (FIG. 7). In order to examine whether the sensor responds to the oxidation/reduction conditions of intracellular glutathione, the present inventors oxidized intracellular glutathione by sensor-loaded living cells with 1 mM diamide. It was observed that when diamide was added to the culture medium, a sensor reaction in the living cells was induced (FIG. 8A). The sensor fluorescence intensity ratio calculated from images of the living cells was reduced by treatment with diamide (FIG. 8B). Next, living cells were treated with various concentrations of diamide and analyzed, and as a result, it could be seen that the fluorescence intensity ratio of the GolgiFreSH-tracer decreased depending on the concentration of diamide (FIG. 9).

These classes are represented by metformin, sulphonylureas, meglinitides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones (TZD), glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and insulin. Unfortunately, many of these agents exhibit reduced efficacy over time, leading to insufficient glycemic control. Some of these agents are also associated with adverse effects that include weight gain, hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal distress. Therefore, alternative therapies are needed to overcome the limitations associated with conventional anti-hyperglycemic medications.

2342,"DPP-4 inhibitors are of intense interest in the development of a new diabetes therapy and several are currently marketed (FIG. 1). From a medicinal chemistry perspective, the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin possesses a simple structure with no stereogenic centers, and can be prepared in only two simple steps of synthesis. However, being a pyrrolylnitrile derivative, it is prone to molecular instability due to the electrophilic nature of the nitrile group. It may undergo intramolecular cyclization by attack of the nucleophilic amino group of the sp-hybridized carbon of the nitrile group to form a ring of convenient size (6-membered piperazine ring). Therefore, the structure of vildagliptin was envisaged as surrogate for identifying novel DPP-4 inhibitors with high efficacy, increased stability and good safety profiles, for the design and development of drug candidates for treating and controlling T2DM.

2350,"DETAILED DESCRIPTION
",0,US10654800B1.txt,0
2351,"From a molecular design point of view, the binding potency of vildagliptin and other first generation inhibitors depends on satisfying the distinctive features of the S1 and S2 pockets of DPP-4. The S1 pocket is a small hydrophobic cleft surrounded by very hydrophobic environment composed of Tyr-547, Trp-659, Tyr-662, Tyr-666, Val-711 and other residues. The OH of Ser-630 also intrudes into this pocket and is a member of the catalytic triad of residues that attack the scissile electrophilic carbonyl of the substrate peptides (FIG. 2). The S2 pocket has two main features: two glutamic acids in the bridge area between the S1 and S2 and a large hydrophobic pocket that is lined by Phe-357 and Arg-358. Glu-205/Glu-206 were found to bind with a basic nitrogen, which is present in all designed DPP-4 inhibitors to date. The S2 hydrophobic extension can accommodate bulky hydrophobic groups such as adamantane in vildagliptin and sitagliptin since bulkiness secures good selectivity. The P2 groups are well represented by a wide variety sub-structures including aliphatics, biaryls, heterocyclics, etc. The presence of a bulky group at this position insures binding selectivity towards DPP-4 over other dipeptidyl peptidases (e.g. DPP2, DPP8 and DPP9).
",0,US10654800B1.txt,0
2352,"The approach taken herein to discover new DPP-4 inhibitors depended on conserving the adamantylamine group attached to glycine as a P2 group and changing the pyrrolylnitrile to variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic groups with small substituents. In general, the substituents included hydrophobic, hydrophilic, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups. In addition, some alicyclic groups were used to complete the SAR coverage of P1 position. Different ortho, meta and para substituents with different electronic properties were also assessed. However, the size these substituents was limited in order to lessen the potential negative impact of large groups on the binding with DPP-4.

DPP-IV inhibition assay was conducted using a kit purchased from Biovision (Milpitas, Calif., USA). Briefly, DPP-IV enzyme was diluted with Tris buffer and pipetted 50 μl into glass mini-cells. Subsequently the 25 μl of Tris buffer, vildagliptin or the tested compounds was added and incubated at 37° C. for 20 mM protected from light. Finally a volume of 25 μl of DPP-IV substrate was added into each tube. The fluorescence generated from hydrolysis of the substrate was read at Ex/Em=360/460 nm using Modulus® single tube multimode reader (Promega, USA). Baseline fluorescence was recorded before incubation (R1) and 20 mM after incubation (R2). Percentage inhibition was calculated according to the following equation: [in-line-formulae]% inhibition=(ΔRFU test/ΔRFU EC)*100[/in-line-formulae] where, ΔRFU=R2−R1 and EC is the enzyme control (enzyme solution without inhibitor) which is considered 100% activity.

Sigmoidal concentration-response curves for DPP-IV % inhibition versus log concentration were plotted using Graphpad prism software, version 5.00 (GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, Calif., USA). The IC50 value corresponds to the concentration of sample needed to inhibit DPP-IV by 50%.

2447,"Although the compounds in this study were designed against a specific target (DPP-4), we performed both phenotypic and target screening assays for each compound. This is because the main objective of this research is the discovery of advanced leads based on a well-established scaffold. The rationale for running both assays was the frequent literature mismatch between the data from in vitro and in vivo assays that might lead to a wrong decision about compounds to pick for further pharmacological studies.

The aromatic derivatives showed mixed results in enzyme inhibition tests, but this could be broadly explained by certain variation in the structures. If we closely check the inhibition results, the compounds with the highest potency possessed electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring. In this trend, we observed sub-nanomolar to single digit nanomolar activities for compounds with an electron withdrawing group placed at the mew position of the benzene ring. For example, the 3-cyanophenyl 26 had an enzymatic inhibition value of less than 1 nM.
",0,US10654800B1.txt,0
2486,"The compounds without an alcoholic OH on the adamantyl ring and/or in which the electron withdrawing group is in a position other than the mew showed a small decrease in activity, although they are still in the range under 10 nM. For example, the m-cyano analogue 110, a deoxy congener of 26, exhibited activity at 3 nM. Other compounds having the same level of activity (1-10 nM) possess deactivated benzene, confirming the suitability of this structural feature for good binding with DPP-4. Some of these compounds have the electron-withdrawing group at the ortho position, such as the 2-pyridyl analogue 119, which has an inhibitory activity of 1.6 nM. The presence of a small electron-withdrawing group in the para position of the aromatic ring resulted in high enzyme binding activities (under 10 nM). This category of compounds is represented by potent inhibitors 112 (4-chloro), 117 (4-chloropyridyl) and 118 (4-cyano). The mew substitution with electron withdrawing but bulky group such as CF3 (15) did not show good activity.
",0,US10654800B1.txt,0
2487,"An exception of electron deficient ring feature is the compound 1, a phenyl derivative without substituents, which had a potency of IC50 5.9. The most surprising deviation from the above mentioned electronic requirement are the ortho tolyl analogues 2 that exerted inhibition at 10.3 and 6.3 nM respectively. Its meta (30) and para methyl (3) congeners as well as the ortho,ortho dimethyl homologue (120) have much weaker enzyme inhibition activities.
",0,US10654800B1.txt,0
2488,"The aromatic ring having ortho substituents were universally weaker enzyme inhibitors than those with mew substituents, followed by para substituents, except the scantily understood ortho methyl analogues 2 and 103. Regardless, the nature of the majority of ortho or para substituents showed that the activities were not promising for these derivatives. The nitrile functionality at the P1 position provided high affinity towards the enzyme regardless its position (compounds 26, 110 and 118). The ortho compound 19, a compound with OH at the adamantyl group at P2 position, was an exception to nitrile performance. This can be considered a structure-activity relationship (SAR) issue pertaining to cooperative binding of all parts of the molecule (P1 and P2). In this regard, the presence of an electron withdrawing group at the para position gave inconsistent SAR features. Some para chloro and para nitrile analogues such as the deoxy congeners 112, 117 and 118 exerted high DPP-4 inhibition while the equivalent hydroxyadamantyl derivatives (such as 43) were weak inhibitors at high concentration. The fluoro analogues (27, 31) and trifluromethyl (14 & 15) analogues were generally weak regardless their position. The presence of bulky groups on the ring generally weakened the enzyme inhibition activities (5 & 16) while the pyridyl ring (117 and 119) conferred the best functionality in enzyme inhibition activity. All pyridyl derivatives had potencies under 10 nM. Encouraged by the pyridyl profile, we tested the isosteric thiazolyl ring. Unfortunately, the two tested thiazolyl compounds (98) were not active at reasonable levels.
",0,US10654800B1.txt,0
2489,"The phenolic derivatives varied in their enzyme inhibition activities as the mew analogue (17) and para (60) exhibited very weak activity. These two derivatives have another hydroxyl group on the S2 adamantyl ring. The deoxy meta analogue (111) exhibited much better performance in the same assay.
",0,US10654800B1.txt,0
2490,"The lack of biological activity of the alkyl deoxy analogue 113 can be attributed to poor solubility (the analogue ishighly lipophilic). This observation agrees with the SAR of vildagliptin as reported by Villhauer et al.

In addition, the controlled physico-chemical properties of the tested compounds indicated that they could have good pharmacokinetic properties. Based on results of the enzyme inhibition assays, in vivo screening was conducted. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed over six days on diabetic mice. The glucose level was monitored daily (Table 3). The results were analyzed for activities after a single dose (Table 4) and after the 6th dose of the drug (Table 5).Inspection of in vivo activities revealed that results are not completely parallel with enzymatic inhibition activities (Table 6).

2609,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,US10815179B1.txt,0
2610,"Dicarbinols are useful in a variety of chemical applications such as plasticizers, diluents, wetting agents and paint additives and as intermediates in chemical processes. Diluents, wetting agents and paint additives often are volatile and evaporate into the atmosphere during use. For example, coalescing aids that are added to water-based paints, act as temporary plasticizers in latex emulsions. The coalescing aids lower the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the latex polymer and as the paint dries, the polymers that have been softened by the coalescing aid are allowed to flow together and form a film after the water has left the system. Coalescing aids that are volatile evaporate out of the film. This allows the polymer to return to the original Tg thereby giving harder films for better block and print resistant coatings.
",0,US10815179B1.txt,0
2611,"Due to environmental concerns, the use of volatile materials such as paint additives, plasticizers, diluents, wetting agents and coalescing aids are increasing undesirable. There is a need for materials that can be used as paint additives, plasticizers, diluents, wetting agents and coalescing aids that exhibit low volatility. There is also a need for materials that can be used to make paint additives, plasticizers, diluents, wetting agents and coalescing aids that have low volatility.

This test may be conducted generally by heating the sample in a forced air oven at 110° C. for 60 minutes. The weight loss after the test is deemed to result from a loss of volatiles originally present in the sample; the percent volatile present in the original sample may then be calculated. Although the cited test can be conducted on coating compositions containing other components such as latex polymers, the values cited herein may be obtained from a sample of the additive itself. Thus, the weight percent volatile of a film-hardening aid may be used herein as a yardstick to measure the amount of VOC the additive would contribute to the VOC in a particular end use such as a component of a coating composition.

",2,US10815179B1.txt,0
2655,"To a 4-necked round-bottom flask fitted with thermocouple, nitrogen inlet, and overhead stirrer was added glycol ether (5 equiv.). Then the di-epoxide was added all at once. The mixture was heated to an internal temperature of 50° C. (note: the 1,4-di-epoxide is a solid that requires some additional time for dissolution; the 1,3-di-epoxide is a liquid at room temperature). The KOH (90%, flakes, 2 equiv.) was added portion-wise such that the internal temperature did not exceed 70° C. (usually over the course of 1 to 1.5 hrs). Once the addition of base was complete, the reaction was monitored by 1H NMR (aliquot was dissolved in DMSO-d6). After the di-epoxide was completely consumed, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The mixture was then poured into ice water. Toluene was added to the mixture and then acetic acid (2.05 equiv. was added). The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel. After layer separation, the aqueous layer was back-extracted with ethyl acetate. The organics were combined and dried with MgSO4, while stirring with activated carbon. The mixture was filtered, and the volatiles were removed using a rotary evaporator. Kugelrohr distillation was used to remove excess glycol ether, if needed.

2733,"Compounds including a polymerizable group (polymerizable compounds) have been used for producing various optical materials. For example, a polymer having a uniform orientation can be prepared by polymerizing a polymerizable composition including a polymerizable compound which has been arranged in a pattern while being in a liquid crystal state. Such a polymer can be used for producing polarizing plates, phase-retardation plates, and the like, which are necessary in the production of displays. The polymerizable composition typically includes two or more polymerizable compounds in order to meet the demands for optical properties, polymerization velocity, solubility, melting point, glass transition temperature, and the transparency, mechanical strength, surface hardness, heat resistance, and lightfastness of the polymer. The polymerizable compounds included in the polymerizable composition are required to enhance physical properties of the polymerizable composition without degrading the other properties of the polymerizable composition.
",0,US20180002276A1.txt,0
2734,"There has been a demand for phase-retardation films having a small or reverse wavelength dispersion of birefringence in order to increase the viewing angles of liquid crystal displays. Accordingly, various polymerizable liquid crystal compounds having a reverse- or small-wavelength dispersion have been developed as a material for such phase-retardation films. However, when the polymerizable compounds are added to a polymerizable composition, the polymerizable compounds cause crystals to precipitate, that is, the polymerizable compounds degrade the preservation stability of the polymerizable composition (PTL 3). Furthermore, when the polymerizable composition is applied to a base material and polymerization is subsequently performed, inconsistencies are likely to be formed in the resulting film (PTL 1 to PTL 3). If the film having inconsistencies is used as a material for, for example, displays, nonuniformity in the brightness of the screen and unnatural colors may occur. This significantly degrades the quality of displays. Consequently, the development of a polymerizable liquid crystal compound having a reverse- or small-wavelength dispersion, with which the above issues may be addressed, has been anticipated.

2891,"The polymerization of a polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound according to the present invention is preferably performed by irradiating the polymerizable liquid crystal composition with an active energy ray, such as ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam, in order to perform polymerization in a short time. In the case where ultraviolet radiation is used, either of a polarized light source and an unpolarized light source may be used. In the case where the polymerization of the liquid crystal composition is performed while the liquid crystal composition is interposed between two substrates, at least one of the substrates which is irradiated with the active energy ray needs to be adequately permeable to the active energy ray. After a specific portion of the liquid crystal composition has been polymerized by using a mask when the liquid crystal composition is irradiated with the light, the conditions such as an electric field, a magnetic field, or a temperature may be changed in order to change the orientation of the other portion of the liquid crystal composition that has not yet been polymerized.

3049,"The bromodomain (BRD) family of proteins recognizes and binds to the acetylated lysine acting as a reader of lysine acetylation state. These “epigenetic readers” bind to acetyllysine residues on the tails of histones H3 and H4, and regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. There is increasing evidence of their role in human disease, and recently a number of small-molecule nihibitors have been reported. There is increasing evidence for the roles of BRDs in disease including inflammation, neurological indications, viral infection, cancers, and autoimmune disorder.
",0,US20180008574A1.txt,0
3050,"An analysis of the human proteome has revealed that there are eight distinct BRD families, representing 61 different BRDs from 46 separate proteins, although others may still be undiscovered. The BET family of BRDs is a subset of this larger bromodomain family and is made up of four members: BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT in humans. BRD2 and BRD3 are reported to associate with histones along activity transcribed genes and may be involved in facilitating transcriptional elongation, while BRD4 appears to be involved in the recruitment of the P-TEFb complex to inducible genes, resulting in phosphorylation of RNApolymerase and increased transcription output. Chromosomal translocation of BRD3 and BRD4 to the nuclear protein in testis (NUT) locus generates BRD3-NUT or BRD4-NUT fusion protein that results in c-Myc overexpression and NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), an aggressive squamous cell malignancy unresponsive to conventional chemotherapeutics. BRDT is uniquely expressed in the testes and ovary.

3051,"Recently, a number of small-molecule compounds with potent inhibitory activity against BET family proteins have been reported. The first potent BET inhibitor was the diazepine JQ1 by nuclear magnetic resonance technology, subsequently, more molecues were reported by epigenetic screening and targeted biochemistry. By these potent inhibitors, more knowledge about the relationship of BET proteins and diseases was disclosed. Rapid progress in the development of bromodomain ligands has stimulated extensive interest and has led to several BET bromodomain inhibitors reaching clinical trials for cancers and inflammations.

3083,"In the compounds of the present invention, when any variable (e.g., R1, R2, etc.) appears more than once in any component, the definition of each occurrence is independent of the other occurrence of each occurrence. Likewise, a combination of substituents and variables is allowed, as long as the combination stabilizes the compound. The lines from the substituents into the ring system indicate that the indicated bond can be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms. If the ring system is a polycyclic, it means that the bond is only attached to any suitable carbon atom adjacent to the ring. It is to be understood that one of ordinary skill in the art can select the substituents and substitutions of the compounds of the present invention to provide compounds that are chemically stable and readily synthesizable from readily available starting materials by techniques of the art and the methods set forth below. If the substituents themselves are substituted by more than one group, it is to be understood that these groups may be on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms as long as the structure is stable. The term “alkyl”, “alkylene” as used herein mean to include branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having a specific number of carbon atoms. For Example, the definition of “C1-C4” in the “C1-C4” alkyl group includes a group having 1, 2, 3, 4 carbon atoms in a straight chain or branched chain. For Example, the “C1-C4” alkyl group specifically includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl and isobutyl. Unless additional defined, alkyl, cycloalkyl and heterocyclyl substituents may be unsubstituted or substituted. For Example, the C1-C4 alkyl group may be substituted by one, two or three substituents selected from halogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, trifluoromethyl, cyano, amino, phenyl diazenyl, -CONH2, -COOR, -COR7, -OR7, -NHCOR7, -NHCOOR7, -C6H5R8, morpholinyl, piperidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, pyridyl, wherein R7 is selected from C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl; R8 is optionally substituted with a substituent selected from C1 to C4 alkyl, halogen, acetyl, methoxy, ethoxy.

3685,"Estrogen Receptor alpha is a nuclear receptor that is activated by the hormone estrogen. Upon estrogen binding, Estrogen Receptor alpha undergoes a conformational change and dimerizes, which, along with other regulation factors, leads to a proliferation of cancerous cells. Approximately 75% of breast cancers express Estrogen Receptor alpha and exhibit estrogen-dependent proliferation. Morales, A. R., et al. Am. J. Clin. Path. 2005; 123: 21-27. Estrogen Receptor alpha is implicated in a variety of cancers, such as, but not limited to, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, and esophageal cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and its incidence rate increases every year.
",0,US20180016269A1.txt,0
3686,"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that interact with intracellular Estrogen Receptors and act as agonists or antagonists. SERMs are used for treating various estrogen-related diseases, including breast cancer, infertility, ovulatory dysfunction, postmenopausal osteoporosis, estrogen-related gynecomastia, dyspareunia due to menopause, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been reported that SERMs have beneficial effects on serum lipids in postmenopausal women.
",0,US20180016269A1.txt,0
3687,"Tamoxifen is the most commonly used SERM and is widely used in treating Estrogen Receptor alpha positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, Tamoxifen activates other genes, which correlates with an increased incidence of other cancers, for example, endometrial cancer. Bernstein, L. et al. J. Natl Cancer Inst 1999; 91: 1654-62. Further, many cancer patients who receive Tamoxifen will eventually develop resistance. Ring, A. et al. Endocr Relat Cancer 2004; 11: 643-58. Upon failure of Tamoxifen treatment, patients may be prescribed Fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader via proteasomal degradation.
",0,US20180016269A1.txt,0
3688,"Tamoxifen competes with estrogen to bind to Estrogen Receptor alpha, whereas Fulvestrant is an antagonist. Fulvestrant's effects are to degrade the Estrogen Receptor alpha protein as opposed to prevent conformational changes and/or dimerization. Although Fulvestrant is an improvement over the deleterious effects of Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant suffers from poor drug-like properties, for example, poor bioavailability and intramuscular administration. Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved method of inhibiting cellular proliferation driven by Estrogen Receptor alpha. Fulvestrant's mechanism of action, where the proteasome is engaged to degrade Estrogen Receptor alpha, provides an alternative mechanism to inhibiting Estrogen Receptor alpha driven cell proliferation. However, general proteasome degradation is not selective, and therefore could lead to deleterious effects. Accordingly, there is a need to discover and develop a drug that could lead to selective Estrogen Receptor alpha degradation, without the side effects caused by Tamoxifen or Fulvestrant.

3689,"The present disclosure describes compounds that may be used to bind to both Estrogen Receptor alpha and a ubiquitin ligase. The compounds of the present disclosure possess two binding motifs conjugated via a linker. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that Estrogen Receptor alpha degradation may occur when both Estrogen Receptor alpha and a ubiquitin ligase are bound and brought into close proximity.

4641,"BACKGROUND
",0,US20180057448A1.txt,0
4642,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins are key enzymes involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, HDAC-mediated deacetylation of acetyllysine residues on nucleosomal histones leads to tight binding to genomic DNA, which affects accessibility and transcription.1-2 In addition, HDAC proteins influence protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, protein localization, and protein stability through deacetylation of non-histone substrates.3-4 The eighteen human HDAC proteins are divided into four classes according to their homology with yeast proteins, size, cellular localization, and number of catalytic active sites.5 Class III (SIRT1-7) HDAC proteins are NAD+-dependent. Classes I (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), II (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10), and IV (HDAC11) HDAC proteins are metal-dependent, and are the focus of this work.5
",0,US20180057448A1.txt,0
4643,"HDAC proteins regulate the expression of several cancer-related proteins involved in cell signaling, transcription, and tumor suppression through the deacetylation of nucleosomal histone proteins.6-7 Overexpression of HDAC proteins results in unregulated transcription and aberrant protein activity and function, which is linked to several diseases, including cancer.7 For example, HDAC1 was overexpressed in lung,8 breast,9 and colon cancers.10 HDAC2 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer.11 HDAC8 was highly expressed in neuroblastoma patients, leading to cancer progression and poor survival rates.12 In addition, selective inhibition of HDAC8 induced apoptosis in leukemia and T-cell lymphoma cell lines.13 Class II HDAC6 was overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer.14-15 Overexpression of both HDAC6 and HDAC8 was linked to breast cancer metastasis and invasion.16
",0,US20180057448A1.txt,0
4644,"Due to their key role in cancer, several anti-cancer agents targeting HDAC proteins have been developed.17 HDAC inhibitors promoted apoptosis and reduced proliferation and migration through their effect on both histone and non-histone substrates.17-19 Several HDAC inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of cancer, and several others are in clinical trials.20 SAHA (suberoylamide hydroxamic acid, Vorinostat, Zolinza™), and Belinostat (PXD101, Belodaq™) are FDA-approved for treatment of T-cell lymphoma (FIG. 1),20-22 while Panobinostat (LBH-589, Farydak™) was approved for treatment of multiple myeloma (FIG. 1).23 SAHA is a nonselective inhibitor that targets most of the eleven metal-dependent HDAC isoforms.24 The nonselectivity of the FDA-approved drugs, including SAHA, might explain the side effects observed in the clinic, such as cardiac arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.25-26 Moreover, the use of SAHA as a chemical tool to study the role of specific HDAC isoforms in cancer cell biology is limited due to its nonselectivity.

4645,"To overcome the limitations of nonselective drugs, several isoform selective HDAC inhibitors have been developed, with some in clinical trials. As illustrative examples, entinostat (MS-275, FIG. 1) is selective for HDAC1, 2, and 3,24, 27 whereas tubastatin (FIG. 1) is HDAC6-selective.28-29 Recently, several dual HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors have been reported, including BRD-73954 and valpropylhydroxamic acid (FIG. 1).30-31 HDAC inhibitors that target one or two HDAC isoforms will be valuable for development of new drugs with minimal side effects.32-35 In addition, recent reports suggested that inhibition of two HDAC isoforms is desirable by maintaining synergistic therapeutic effects in various cancers.30, 36-37 Related to this work, dual inhibition of HDAC6 and HDAC8 might have potential application in breast cancer angiogenesis and metastasis.13, 30 Moreover, selective HDAC inhibitors will be useful as chemical tools to study cancer-related HDAC cell biology.

4646,"To understand the structural requirements of HDAC inhibitors, SAHA analogs substituted have been synthesized in the linker region at carbon 2 (C2), carbon 3 (C3), or carbon 6 (C6) (FIG. 1).38-40 C2-hexyl SAHA (FIG. 1) showed HDAC6/8 dual selectivity over HDAC1, 2, and 3, with 0.6 and 2.0 μM potency against HDAC6 and HDAC8, respectively.41 Some of the C3-modified SAHA analogs displayed preference for HDAC6 over HDAC1 and 3,39 while some of the C6-modified SAHA analogs inhibited HDAC1 and 6 over HDAC3.40 In addition, SAHA analogs modified at the hydroxamic acid moiety had a preference for HDAC1.42

4649,"Against the prior art background set forth above, SAHA analogs modified at the C4 position were synthesized and screened in vitro and in cellulo for their activity and selectivity. Several C4-modified SAHA analogs showed high selectivity towards HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3, with nanomolar potency against HDAC6 and HDAC8. Docking studies provided a structural rationale for the observed selectivity. These studies emphasize that modification of the SAHA linker can enhance isoform selectivity. In addition, the HDAC6/8 dual selective C4-SAHA analogs reported here have the potential to be useful pharmacological tools for biomedical research and lead compounds for anti-cancer drug development.

Different substituents were appended to 4 via 1,4-addition using organolithium cuprates, followed by Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction with benzyl phosphonoacetate 5 to give the unsaturated benzyl esters 6a-f. Reduction and hydrogenolysis of 6a-f gave free acids 7a-f, which were coupled with aniline to afford 8a-f. Finally, esters 8a-f were reacted with hydroxylamine to afford the C4-substituted SAHA derivatives 1a-f as racemic mixtures.

4692,"SAHA analogs 1a-f were tested for global HDAC inhibition with HeLa cell lysates as the source of all HDAC proteins (Table 1). HDAC activity was measured using the commercially available HDAC-Glo™ I/II substrate (Promega). The results of the screening showed that all of the synthesized derivatives were less potent than SAHA (Table 1 and 2, and FIG. 5). The most potent derivative was C4-methyl SAHA (1a), which showed an IC50 value of 3.3 μM. Compared to the parent molecule SAHA, C4-methyl SAHA is 18-fold less potent, while the rest of the analogs showed 78- to 344-fold reduction in potency. Because HeLa cell lysates contain all HDAC isoforms, the poor potency of the C4-SAHA analogs suggests that they might be selective for specific isoforms.

4745,"To assess selectivity, an initial screen was performed with analogs 1a-f and the parent molecule SAHA at a single concentration against HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 using an ELISA-based HDAC activity assay.28 These select isoforms were chosen due to their high deacetylation activity among the family members and their representation of both class I (HDAC1, 2, and 3) and class II (HDAC6). SAHA, as expected, showed no selectivity among HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6, inhibiting their activity to a similar extent (FIG. 2). Interestingly, all C4-SAHA analogs (1a-f) displayed more potent inhibition against HDAC6 compared to HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 (FIG. 2 and Table 3). The analogs that showed the greatest difference in potency with HDAC6 versus the other isoforms were C4-n-butyl (1c) and C4-benzyl (1f). The C4-methyl SAHA analog (1a) showed the smallest difference in potency comparing HDAC6 to HDAC1 and HDAC3 (FIG. 2 and Table 3). This single concentration screen suggested that C4-modification of the SAHA structure results in selectivity for HDAC6.

4764,"To further assess selectivity, IC50 values for derivatives 1b-f were determined with HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8 isoforms (Table 4). HDAC8 was included due to its similar active site structure compared to HDAC6.31 For comparison, the non-selective parent molecule SAHA and the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin (FIG. 1) were also tested as control compounds (Table 4).28 As expected, the non-selective inhibitor SAHA showed similar low nanomolar IC50 values with HDAC1, 2, 3, 6, but a 6- to 27-fold reduction in potency against HDAC8.28 In contrast, the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin displayed 87- to 130-fold selectivity for HDAC6 over HDAC1, 2, and 3, and 11-fold selectivity for HDAC6 over HDAC8, which is consistent with prior studies.28, 41 As expected based on the single concentration screen, analogs 1b-f displayed preference for HDAC6 and HDAC8, with 28- to 740-fold selectivity compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3 (Tables 2 and 5). Importantly, analogs 1b-f maintained low nanomolar IC50 values in the 57 to 290 nM range with HDAC6 and HDAC8 (Tables 2), similar to SAHA. Among the analogs, C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) displayed the highest selectivity, with 210- to 740-fold selectivity for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 (Table 4 and 5), and potent inhibition with low nanomolar IC50 values (140 and 57 nM with HDAC6 and HDAC8, respectively, Table 4). Similarly, C4-n-butyl (1c) and C4-n-hexyl (1d) SAHA demonstrated 170- to 480-fold HDAC6/8-selectivity compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3 isoforms, with low nanomolar IC50 values (Tables 2 and 5). The C4-ethyl (1b) SAHA analog displayed the weakest selectivity among the analogs, with 28- and 46-fold selectivities for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 (Tables 2 and 5). Comparing the IC50 values of the analogs to the parent SAHA (Table 4), the higher HDAC6 selectivities are due to minimal reductions in HDAC6 inhibition (2.5 to 3-fold reduction), but dramatically reduced potency against HDAC1, 2 and 3 (51- to 2,100-fold reduction, Table 4). Remarkably, the analogs displayed enhanced potency with HDAC8 compared to the parent SAHA compound (2- to 9-fold enhancement, Table 4), which lead to the observed HDAC8 selectivities.

4977,"In terms of a structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, modifying SAHA at the C4 position with long alkyl substituents led to enhanced selectivity; the C4-hexyl 1d analog with the longest alkyl chain demonstrated elevated selectivity (210- to 480-fold) compared to the C4-butyl 1c analog (170- to 310-fold), which were both more selective than the C4-ethyl analog 1b with the smallest alkyl chain (28- and 46-fold, Tables 4 and 12). For these alkyl analogs, selectivity was due to discrimination against HDAC1, 2, and 3, with the least selective C4-ethyl analog 1b demonstrating greater potency to HDAC1, 2, and 3 (4.4-6.0 μM, Table 4) compared to the most selective C4-hexyl analog 1d (30-38 μM, Table 4). The length of the substituent also influenced the selectivities of the analogs with aryl groups at the C4 position; the lack of a methylene in C4-phenyl analog 1e led to decreased selectivity (38- to 350-fold, Table 12) compared to the C4-benzyl analog 1f (210- to 740-fold). Similar to the alkyl series, the reduced selectivity of C4-phenyl analog 1e was due to greater potency with HDAC1 and 2 (11 and 12 μM, Table 4) compared to C4-benzyl analog 1f (29 and 32 μM, Table 4), in addition to decreased potency with HDAC8 (290 nM, Table 4) compared to C4-benzyl analog 1f (57 nM, Table 4). In total, the SAR analysis indicated that longer substituents at the C4 position led to greater HDAC6/8 selectivity primarily due to discrimination against HDAC1, 2, and 3.

4978,"Compared to previously reported inhibitors, the observed HDAC6 selectivities of the analogs 1c, 1d, and 1f (at least 170-, and 210-fold, Table 12) were higher than the selectivity observed with the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin (at least 87-fold, Tables 4 and 12). Moreover, analogs 1c, 1d, and 1f showed comparable HDAC8 selectivities (at least 200-, 380-, and 510-fold, Table 12) relative to the HDAC8-selective inhibitor PCI-34051 (at least 400-fold).43 Finally, C4-benzyl analog 1f showed higher dual HDAC6/8 selectivity (at least 210- and 510-fold, Table 12) compared to the known HDAC6/8-selective inhibitor BRD-73954 (75- and 250-fold selectivity to HDAC6, and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3).30

4980,"To further assess the observed HDAC6 selectivity in cellulo, the C4-benzyl (1f) SAHA analog was tested for inhibition of HDAC activities in cells. The inhibition of HDAC6 was monitored by detecting the levels of its known substrate acetyl-α-tubulin (AcTub), whereas Class I HDAC proteins (HDAC1, 2, and 3) inhibition was monitored through the levels of their known substrate acetyl-histone H3 (AcH3). SAHA or the analog 1f were incubated with U937 leukemia cells before lysis and western blot analysis of protein acetylation. As expected, SAHA showed increases levels of both acetyl-α-tubulin and acetyl-histone H3 (FIG. 3, lane 2), which is consistent with its non-selective inhibition of HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 isoforms. In contrast, C4-benzyl (1f) showed a dose-dependent increase in levels of acetyl-α-tubulin (FIG. 3, lanes 3-5, AcTub) compared to the DMSO control (FIG. 3, lane 1), which was elevated compared to the levels of acetyl histone H3 (FIG. 3, lanes 3-5, AcH3). Greater acetylation of the HDAC6 substrate tubulin compared to the class I HDAC substrate histone 3 in cells (FIG. 3) is consistent with the HDAC6 selectivity of 1f observed in the in vitro screening (Tables 4 and 12).

4982,"To assess the cytotoxic effect of the HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors in cancer cells, SAHA derivatives 1c, 1d, and 1f were tested with the leukemia cell lines U937 and Jurkat, due to the prominent role of HDAC6 in leukemia.44 To assess cytotoxicity, the EC50 values of SAHA and the three analogs 1c, 1d, and 1f were determined with U937 cell line.44 SAHA showed an EC50 value of 0.88 μM (Table 4), which is consistent with the cytotoxicity previously reported.45 The non-selective inhibition of all the HDAC proteins by SAHA likely contributes to its high cytotoxicity. The C4-n-butyl (1c), C4-n-hexyl (1d), and C4-benzyl (1f) SAHA analogs displayed 34, 16, and 28 μM EC50 values with the U937 cell line, respectively (Table 4). Compared to SAHA, the analogs were 18- to 39-fold less cytotoxic. To confirm the cytotoxicity study in U937 cells, SAHA and the analogs were also tested for cytotoxicity with the Jurkat cell line. The analogs showed reduced cytotoxicity compared to SAHA (FIG. 13 and Table 13), consistent with the study in U937 cells. The reduced cytotoxicity of the analogs in U937 and Jurkat cells compared to SAHA might be due to their selectivity toward HDAC6 and 8. Consistent with this hypothesis, similar micromolar cytotoxicities were also observed with HDAC6-selective inhibitors in previous reports.37, 46-47

4984,"Since all analogs were synthesized and screened as racemic mixtures, single enantiomers of the most selective analog C4-benzyl SAHA 1f were synthesized to test selectivities. The asymmetric syntheses of both enantiomers were carried out utilizing Evan's oxazolidinone chiral auxiliary (R)-8 (Scheme 2).48 To ultimately prepare (R)-1f, 4-pentenoyl chloride was reacted with chiral auxiliary (R)-8 using n-butyllithium, which yielded pentenoyl oxazolidinone intermediate (R)-9 (Scheme 2A). Enantioselective reaction of benzyl bromide with (R)-9 gave the diastereomeric intermediate (RS)-10. To ultimately prepare (S)-1f, a similar procedure was employed (Scheme 2B), but reacting 3-phenylpropanoyl chloride with chiral auxiliary (R)-8, followed by enantioselective reaction with allyl bromide to give diastereomeric intermediate (RR)-10. Both diastereomers were obtained with high diastereomeric ratios (dr), which were assessed by 1HNMR analysis (99:1 dr for (RS)-10, and 97:3 dr for (RR)-10).

Cross metathesis of the methyl esters with N-phenyl acrylamide 15 using Grubbs' second generation catalyst afforded ester amides (S)-16 and (R)-16.5 Finally, reduction followed by substitution with hydroxyl amine gave both enantiomers of C4-benzyl SAHA analog, (R)-1f and (S)-1f (Schemes 3).

4989,"To assess the selectivities of enantiomers (R)-C4-benzyl SAHA (R)-1f and the (S)-C4-benzyl SAHA (S)-1f, IC50 values of both were determined with HDAC1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 (Table 4). Similar to the racemic mixture, both enantiomers showed dual HDAC6/HDAC8 selectivity. (R)-C4-benzy SAHA (R)-1f displayed more potent inhibition against HDAC6 and HDAC8 compared to the (S)-C4-benzyl SAHA (S)-1f, with IC50 values of 48 and 27 nM for (R)-1f and 95 and 150 nM for (S)-1f (Table 4). In addition, (R)-1f showed greater fold preference for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 (520- to 1300-fold, Table 12) compared to the racemic mixture (210- to 740-fold). In contrast, (S)-1f showed lower fold selectivities (240- to 540-fold, Table 12) compared to both (R)-1f and the racemic mixture (Tables 4 and 12). In summary, in vitro screening revealed that both (R)-1f and (S)-1f are highly selective for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 with nanomolar potency. However, (R)-1f was more potent and selective than (S)-1f (Tables 4 and 12).

4991,"To rationalize the experimental results, docking studies with both enantiomers of C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) were performed using the AutoDock 4.2 and Autodock tools programs.51-52 The recently reported crystal structure of HDAC6 (PDB: 5GOH)53 along with HDAC3 crystal structure (PDB: 4A69)54 were used in these studies. SAHA, the parent molecule, was also examined with both crystal structures for comparison and to validate the docking procedure. With HDAC6, both enantiomers of C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) were positioned similarly in the active site compared to SAHA, with the hydroxamic acid moiety near the catalytic metal, the linker region in the 11 Å channel, and the anilide group in the solvent exposed region. In addition, the hydroxamic acid groups bound within 1.9-2.7 Å of the active site residues (H573, H574, and Y745) and the active site catalytic zinc atom (FIG. 4A), similar to that of the parent molecule SAHA (1.7-2.7 Å). Superimposition of each enantiomer with SAHA in the HDAC6 active site showed similar binding of the hydroxamic acid moiety. The docking studies with the HDAC6 crystal structure are consistent with the high binding affinity of C4-benzyl SAHA and SAHA in vitro (Table 4).

4992,"To explain the observed selectivities, (R)-1f and (S)-1f were also docked into the HDAC3 crystal structure. Longer and weaker binding interactions were observed with (R)-1f and (S)-1f in the HDAC3 structure (2.1-5.0 Å, FIG. 4B) compared with the HDAC6 structure (1.9-2.7 Å). Superimposition of each enantiomer with SAHA in the HDAC3 structure showed a shift in the position of the hydroxamic acid moieties away from the catalytic metal compared to SAHA (FIG. 4D). The docking analysis suggests that the presence of a bulky substituent on the C4 position weakens binding to HDAC3 due to steric clash with the relatively narrow and long 11 Å channel of HDAC3. In particular, the steric clash of the bulky substituent with active site residues positions the hydroxamic acid moieties away from the metal binding region (FIG. 4B). In contrast, HDAC6 maintains a wider and shorter V-shaped 11 Å channel, which can accommodate relatively large C4 substituents without affecting hydroxamic acid-metal binding (FIG. 4A).

4993,"Structural analysis of prior HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors are consistent with our docking analysis suggesting that HDAC6 maintains a wider and shorter 11 Å channel compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3.29, 53 Valpropylhydroxamic acid (FIG. 1) with a propyl substituent in the linker region showed selectivity for HDAC6 and 8, although with micromolar potency and low fold selectivity (9-17-fold selectivity against with HDAC1, 2, and 3).55 Inhibitors bearing a bicyclic or phenyl ring in the linker displayed dual HDAC6 and HDAC8 selectivity (BRD-73953 and Aminotetralin 32, FIG. 1).30, 36-37 Finally, SAHA analogs with a hexyl or benzyl substituent at the C2 linker also demonstrated dual HDAC6/8 selectivity (FIG. 1).41 Based on these prior reports and our docking studies, we hypothesize that substitutents at the C4 position of SAHA can be accommodated in the relatively wider and shorter V-shaped 11 Å cavity of HDAC6 active site (FIG. 4A, S155A, 4C, S155C, and S156A), but not the narrower and relatively longer 11 Å cavity of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 (FIGS. 4B and 4D). In addition, the size of the substituent plays a critical role in the selectivity. For example, analogs bearing smaller substituents (as methyl or ethyl in 1a or 1b) demonstrated lower selectivity (Table 2) compared to analogs comprising bulkier substituents (as butyl, hexyl, phenyl, and benzyl 1c-1f) (FIG. 2 and Table 4). In total, the docking results are consistent with previously reported structural studies suggesting that the wider HDAC6 active site entrance is the source of selectivity.

4994,"In conclusion, SAHA analogs modified at the C4 position were synthesized and screened for potency and selectivity. C4-SAHA analogs showed up to 1300-fold dual selectivity for HDAC6 and HDAC8 over HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3. The best analogs were C4-n-butyl SAHA (1c) and C4-benzyl SAHA (1f). C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) showed the highest fold selectivity with 210- to 740-fold selectivity for HDAC6 and 8 compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3, and 140 and 57 nM IC50 with HDAC6 and HDAC8. Interestingly, the fold selectivity of the C4-benzyl SAHA analog was higher than the recently reported dual HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors (at least 23-, 75-, and 79-fold).30, 36-37 Furthermore, in cellulo testing of the C4-benzyl analog showed consistency with the in vitro screening. Enantioselective synthesis and screening of both enantiomers of the C4-benzyl SAHA revealed that (R)-C4-benzyl SAHA is more potent and selective than the (S) enantiomer, with 48 and 27 nM IC50 with HDAC6 and HDAC8, and 520- to 1300-fold selectivity for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3. The dual HDAC6/HDAC8 selective C4-SAHA analogs reported in this work can be useful as biological tools to understand the role of HDAC6 and HDAC8 in cancer, and as well as lead compounds towards development of more effective anti-cancer drugs. More generally, these studies with SAHA analogs suggest that modifying current drugs can significantly improve their properties.

EC50 values were calculated by fitting the percent viable cells as a function of inhibitor concentration to a sigmoidal dose-response curve (y=100/(1+(x/EC50)z), where y=percent viable cells and x=inhibitor concentration) using non-linear regression with KaleidaGraph 4.1.3 software (Tables 2).

5094,"The AutoDock 4.2 and Autodock tools programs51-52 were used to perform the docking studies. HDAC6 catalytic domain 2 (CD2) (PDB: 5GOH)53 and HDAC3 (PDB: 4A69)54 crystal structures were downloaded from the protein data bank. PyMOL program (Schrodinger, LLC) was used to delete the co-crystallized inhibitor (S-trichostatin A), ethylene glycol molecules, potassium ions and all water molecules in HDAC6 crystal structure. With HDAC3 crystal, chain A, deacetylase-activation-domain (DAD) (from the SMRT corepressor), glycerol, D-myo-inositol-1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate and glycerol molecules, acetate, potassium and sulfate ions, and all water molecules were deleted. Only the zinc atom remained in both crystal structures. AutoDockTools-1.5.4 program 51-52 was used to add all polar hydrogen atoms, modify histidine protonation (H573 and H574 residues of HDAC6, and H134 and H135 of HDAC3) by adding only HD1, compute Gasteiger charges, and merge all non polar hydrogen, followed by generation of the pdbqt output file. The charge of the zinc atom was manually changed from zero to +2. For HDAC6, a grid box with a spacing of 0.375 Å, size of 42×40×44, and coordinates for the center of the grid box (−13.000, −2.000, −5.000) were used. For HDAC3, a grid box of size 58×58×54 Å3 with a spacing of 0.375 Å and centered at (8.166, 76.663, 21.318) were used. The map type was set by choosing the ligand and then AutoGrid 4.2 was used to pre-calculate and generate the grid map files required for the docking calculations. All the docked compounds were drawn in ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0, and MM2 energy minimization was done using Chem 3D Pro 12.0. Then AutoDockTools-1.5.4 program was used to add hydrogens, compute Gasteiger charges, merge non-polar hydrogens, choose torsions, and generate the pdbqt files. All acyclic bonds were made rotatable, except the amide bonds. The AutoDock 4.2 program was used to perform the docking calculations using a genetic algorithm. The generated pdbqt file for the enzymes were set as a rigid macromolecule and the genetic algorithm search parameters were set to 100 GA runs for each ligand with a population size of 150, a maximum number of 2.5×105 energy evaluations, a maximum number of 2.7×104 generations, a mutation rate of 0.2 and a crossover rate of 0.8. The docking parameters were set to default. All output DLG files were converted to pdbqt format and the results were visualized in PyMOL. Among the 100 docked poses generated, the lowest energy poses displaying optimal distances between the hydroxamic acid group of the inhibitor and the catalytic metal of the protein were discussed in the text.

",0,US20180072767A1.txt,0
5101,"Trehalose (D-glucose-α-1,1-α-D-glucose) is a disaccharide sugar that is prevalent throughout nature, but not found in mammals. Trehalose is an essential metabolite for mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and is responsible for millions of deaths yearly and is a major global health threat due to drug resistance. Because trehalose and its derivatives, such as O-acylated derivatives (e.g., trehalose mono- and dimycolate) are integral to Mtb physiology and pathogenesis, yet absent from the human host, trehalose metabolism may be a target for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

5102,"SUMMARY
",0,US20180072767A1.txt,0
5103,"Known trehalose analogues have potential liabilities with respect to specificity for Mtb. For example, known trehalose analogues can undergo lipidation and subsequent non-covalent association with the Mtb cell wall. This may be problematic because non-covalently associated molecules can shed from the cell wall, potentially resulting in loss of specificity for the bacterium. In addition, known trehalose analogues can potentially be metabolized by microorganisms other than mycobacteria, which can reduce specificity for Mtb. Accordingly, there is need for improved trehalose analogues.

",0,US20180072767A1.txt,0
5112,"The present disclosure describes a class of trehalose analogues. The analogues can be used for the detection and therapeutic targeting of mycobacteria. Mycobacteria and other members of the Corynebacterineae have a unique cell envelope that is central to pathogenesis and provides intrinsic drug resistance (FIG. 1). Mycobacteria have plasma membrane (PM) and peptidoglycan (PG) layers, wherein PG is covalently attached to the arabinogalactan (AG) layer, which in turn is covalently modified with long-chain (C60-C90) fatty acids called mycolic acids. These AG-linked mycolates (AGM) are the foundation of the outer membrane, or mycomembrane (MM). In addition to AGM, the MM includes other noncovalently associated lipids and glycolipids, most prominently virulence-associated trehalose dimycolate (TDM).
",0,US20180072767A1.txt,0
5113,"Biosynthesis of the MM is mediated by the disaccharide trehalose (FIG. 1). In the cytoplasm, Pks13 links trehalose to mycolic acid to generate trehalose monomycolate (TMM), which, after translocation across the PM by MmpL3, acts as the mycolyl donor required for construction of the MM. The antigen 85 complex (Ag85), consisting of several mycolyltransferases, is responsible for transferring mycolyl groups from the mycolyl donor TMM to either i) AG, leading to the formation of AGM, or ii) another molecule of TMM, generating TDM. During these processes, trehalose is released and recycled by the transporter SugABC-LpqY. The MM is essential to bacterial viability and many of its constituents are required for virulence in Mtb, so it presents a valuable target for TB diagnostic and drug development.

5114,"It is hypothesized that the disclosed analogues can take advantage of the aforementioned trehalose metabolism of mycobacteria (FIG. 31). This affords the disclosed analogues to be covalently bound to the bacterium, which obviates specificity problems of known trehalose analogues that non-covalently modify bacterium. In addition, mammals do not have enzymes that act on trehalose monomycolate, so the disclosed trehalose analogues may exhibit higher specificity for Mtb in the host environment compared to known trehalose analogues that have their detectable tag located directly on the trehalose disaccharide, which may be broken down in mammals via trehalose-cleaving enzymes called trehalases, or broken down by others types of microorganisms.

5115,"Accordingly, the disclosed trehalose analogues can be advantageous for the detection and targeting of mycobacteria for both diagnostics and therapeutics. Furthermore, the disclosed analogues have a broad flexibility in structure (due in part to the tolerance of the targeted biological machinery), which can permit the delivery of a very broad range of cargo to mycobacteria.

The analogues are designed to mimic naturally occurring biosynthetic substrates called trehalose monomycolate and trehalose dimycolate. In mycobacteria, a group of enzymes called the antigen 85 (Ag85) complex have the function of transferring lipids from trehalose monomycolate onto the cell wall, leading to covalent attachment of the lipid to the bacterium (in nature, this is an essential step for biosynthesis of the Mtb outer membrane).

5248,"Generally, to synthesize O-AlkTMM compounds, Kulkarni's approach was used to access unsymmetrical trehalose esters (Scheme 3A). First, trehalose was subjected to per-O-trimethylsilylation, then both 6-O-trimethylsilyl groups were selectively removed using K2CO3/CH3OH to give diol 7. This C2-symmetric intermediate was desymmetrized in the subsequent step, which entailed 6-O-monoesterification with an appropriate alkyne- or azide-modified carboxylic acid in the presence of N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and catalytic 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP). The intermediate was then desilylated in the presence of Dowex H+ resin, delivering the desired products. The yields for compounds 1-4 over the two-step monoesterification-deprotection sequence ranged from 34-44%.

After drying the reagents under high vacuum and placing the flask under a nitrogen atmosphere, anhydrous CH2Cl2 (30 mL) was added and the mixture was cooled to 0° C. To the stirring solution was added 6-heptynoic acid (490 μL, 3.869 mmol) followed by slow, dropwise addition of a freshly prepared solution of TMS6-trehalose (3.000 g, 3.869 mmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (30 mL).

5335,"O- and N-AlkTMM were first evaluated for metabolic labeling in M. smegmatis mc2155 (Msmeg), which possesses MM biosynthetic pathways and architecture that are representative of other species in the Corynebacterineae. Wild-type Msmeg was cultured in the presence of varying concentrations (1-250 m) of O- or N-AlkTMM until late-log phase (14 h) and then reacted with an azido fluorophore (Az488) under Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) conditions. Flow cytometry analysis showed successful labeling for both probes, although different labeling efficiencies were observed (FIG. 2). O-AlkTMM exhibited strong labeling even at very low concentrations; a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of >20 was observed at concentrations as low as 1 mm. O-AlkTMM labeling was saturable at 50 mm concentration and a S/N of >250. By comparison, N-AlkTMM labeling was less efficient, giving approximately 10-fold lower signal at the same concentrations, yet the S/N still reached >150 under the conditions tested. The high S/N at relatively low doses and the absence of growth defects during treatment (FIG. 10) make both O- and N-AlkTMM appealing as chemical reporters. Additionally, no growth impairment was observed for either compound up to 250 M.

5336,"The observed dose-dependent labeling suggested that active metabolic incorporation of the disclosed AlkTMM probes was occurring, which was further supported by experiments evaluating the time- and growth phase-dependence of labeling, as well as competition experiments (FIG. 3-5). Both O- and N-AlkTMM exhibited time-dependent increases in labeling until signal saturation occurred between 2-4 h, which is the approximate doubling time for Msmeg. Of note, significant labeling could be detected for O- and N-AlkTMM after only a few seconds of culture time, suggesting that they may be useful for probing mycolylation processes that occur on extremely short timescales. Growth phase dependence experiments showed a significant decrease in O- and N-AlkTMM labeling between log- and stationary-phase Msmeg. Labeling was also reduced by competition with unlabeled versions of the probes (synthesized by Pd-catalyzed alkyne reduction of O- and N-AlkTMM), further confirming metabolic incorporation of the disclosed AlkTMM probes. Additionally, the specificity data, presented herein, strongly support the hypothesized labeling routes and molecular targets for O- and N-AlkTMM.

5337,"To establish that O- and N-AlkTMM were incorporated into MM components through Ag85, labeling experiments were performed in the presence of ebselen, which was identified as a covalent inhibitor of all Ag85 isoforms in M. tuberculosis. Upon treatment of Msmeg with ebselen, O- and N-AlkTMM labeling decreased by approximately 70% and 85%, respectively, confirming their Ag85 specificity (FIG. 6). To rule out the possibility that the observed signal loss was due to a general reduction in cellular metabolism, it was confirmed that ebselen treatment did not reduce Msmeg labeling using 6-TreAz, which is known to be incorporated into cell wall TMM in an Ag85-independent manner; rather, it traverses an intracellular route consisting of SugABC-LpqY/Pks13/MmpL3. It was also verified that, in contrast to 6-TreAz, incorporation of O- and N-AlkTMM was not dependent on the trehalose transporter SugABC-LpqY (FIG. 11). Together, these data support the hypothesized periplasmic route of AlkTMM incorporation by Ag85 (FIG. 31).

5338,"It was hypothesized that O- and N-AlkTMM would have distinct targets in the MM, with O-AlkTMM selectively reporting on AGM and N-AlkTMM reporting on trehalose glycolipids. Specifically, it was hypothesized that O-AlkTMM would be able to access the cellular periplasm and serve as a substrate for Ag85, leading to transfer of the 6-heptynoyl group to terminal AG residues, and that N-AlkTMM would be able to serve as a mycolylation acceptor and predominantly form a labeled version of TDM. To differentiate between these possibilities, Msmeg was treated with O- or N-AlkTMM, conjugated Az488 by CuAAC, and then Msmeg cells were fractionated into i) insoluble cell wall material, including the PG-AGM complex, and ii) soluble extractable lipids, including the trehalose glycolipids. TLC analysis confirmed separation of trehalose glycolipids from the PGAGM material (FIG. 12). Analysis of solubilized samples revealed that nearly all of the fluorescence from O-AlkTMM treated Msmeg was present in the PG-AGM fraction, while N-AlkTMM-treated Msmeg showed signal only in the extractable lipids fraction, supporting the hypothesized probe selectivity (FIG. 7). As a control, the same experiment was performed with 6-TreAz, which is known to label trehalose glycolipids with high efficiency but not AGM. The 6-TreAz-treated sample showed signal exclusively in the extractable lipids fraction, matching the results from N-AlkTMM. The nominal fluorescence observed in the extractable lipids fraction of the O-AlkTMM-treated sample likely corresponds to a small fraction of this probe reacting with TMM to form alkyne-labeled TDM (estimated at <10% based on FIG. 7).

5339,"Next, the specificity of O- and N-AlkTMM was assessed for species in the Corynebacterineae suborder. While these species possess the conserved MM biosynthetic machinery (FIG. 1), canonical Gram-negative and -positive bacteria do not. Thus, O- and N-AlkTMM labeling in Msmeg and C. glutamicum was evaluated, both of which are members of the Corynebacterineae, as well as in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which are representative Gram-negative and -positive species, respectively. Both Msmeg and C. glutamicum showed strong labeling of the cell surface by O- and N-AlkTMM, while E. coli and B. subtilis showed no labeling above background (FIGS. 8 and 9).

5340,"To demonstrate how the disclosed compounds can provide insight into MM dynamics, O- and N-AlkTMM were used to image AGM and TDM biosynthesis in Msmeg using time-course fluorescence microscopy (FIG. 9 (lower panel) and 14-15). O- and N-AlkTMM exhibited similar labeling features, characterized by intensely fluorescent septa in dividing cells, highly polar labeling for short pulses, and diffuse surface labeling for longer pulses. It was also shown that AGM and trehalose glycolipids can be simultaneously imaged by co-administering O-AlkTMM and 6-TreAz, which bear orthogonal reactive tags, followed by delivery of green and red fluorophores using appropriate bioorthogonal reactions (FIG. 16). Cells only showed strong signal in both the 488 and Texas Red channels when co-treated with O-AlkTMM and 6-TreAz, indicating that both components can be detected simultaneously. The 488 channel (detecting O-AlkTMM labeling) showed fluorescence fairly evenly distributed around the lateral wall, which is consistent with the 4 h time point from the time-course fluorescence microscopy experiment (FIG. 14-15). Likewise, signal in the Texas Red channel (detecting 6-TreAz) showed fluorescence distributed around the cell surface, with some areas of higher intensity. These experiments represent the first direct visualization of the AGM layer in mycobacteria, and they underscore how the disclosed compounds may advance understanding of mycobacterial growth and division processes, which remain poorly characterized in comparison to other types of bacteria.

The chemical reporters described herein are mycobacteria-specific, connoting potential for detection of bacteria in complex settings, for example, in sputum samples or during infection. Additionally, the ability of Ag85 to catalyze the transfer of non-native lipids from the disclosed compounds to AG represents a strategy for cell surface modification of live mycobacteria. Coupled with the ease of synthesizing the disclosed compounds, this strategy can facilitate chemical remodeling of the MM for various applications.

5357,"With compounds 1-6 in hand, the first objective was to evaluate the O-AlkTMM series (1-3) to determine whether changes in chain length had an impact on labeling efficiency. Native mycolic acids are α-branched and β-hydroxylated, and they contain anywhere from 22-100 total carbons, depending on the species. The shortened linear chain of the TMM reporter, O-AlkTMM-C7, was a fairly significant simplification of the native mycolate, but the compound was still efficiently incorporated into the mycomembrane. In this Example, it was hypothezied that longer-chain reporters would have favorable incorporation. To test this hypothesis, Msmeg was cultured in 50 μM of each reporter, then subjected to CuAAC reaction with an azido-488 fluorophore and analyzed by flow cytometry (FIG. 61). Although it was somewhat surprising to observe little difference in labeling between the compounds (a small increase was observed for the longer-chain analogue 3). There are criteria to be considered for selection of TMM reporter chain length for a given application. The smaller C5 and C7 reporters are conveniently water-soluble, whereas larger C11 (and higher) reporters require organic co-solvent (e.g., DMSO or ethanol) to solubilize. On the other hand, the TMM reporters with longer chains are more likely to faithfully replicate the biophysical properties of native TMM within a cellular environment.

5358,"TMM reporter (1-3)-labeled bacteria must be fixed prior to carrying out traditional CuAAC reactions on the cell surface. By contrast, TMM reporters 4-6 were designed to enable probing of mycoloylation in living systems, which was investigated next. Each reporter was evaluated over the same concentration range (0-250 μM) in Msmeg and Cglut (FIG. 62). O-AzTMM-C10 (4) labeling was followed by SPAAC reaction on live cells with a dibenzocycloocytne (DBCO)-488 fluorophore; O-TCO-TMM (5) labeling was followed by tetrazine ligation on live cells with a tetrazine-Cy3 fluorophore; since O-FITC-TMM (6) directly delivers the fluorophore during metabolic incorporation, no secondary step was required for this reporter. Cellular fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry. All three reporters led to efficient metabolic labeling of both Msmeg and Cglut as compared to the control cells. Labeling saturation was observed for both O-AzTMM-C10 (4) and O-TCO-TMM (5) at approximately 25 μM concentration, whereas for O-FITC-TMM saturation occurred at higher concentrations (>100 μM), presumably due to the larger size of the fluorophore. Interestingly, the reporters with the larger TCO and FITC tags, 5 and 6, were incorporated into Cglut much more efficiently than in Msmeg. This could be due to increased uptake of the larger reporters across the mycomembrane of Cglut, which has shorter mycolic acids and higher fluidity than Msmeg. Notably, growth inhibition or altered cell morphology was not observed upon treatment of bacteria with compounds 1-6 at the highest tested concentrations, demonstrating the apparent non-perturbing nature of these reporters.

5359,"TMM reporters 4-6 provide the ability to probe mycoloylation in live bacteria for the first time. O-FITC-TMM (6), or related fluorophore-modified TMM reporters (which can be readily accessed from 8 as shown in Scheme 3B), can be used when a one-step live-cell labeling workflow is desired. For example, one-step labeling may be preferred for its simplicity (e.g., fewer reagents and washes) or when there is concern about whether the secondary fluorophore (or other reagent) has sufficient access to the tagged biomolecule. Two-step labeling can be desirable for many reasons, including generally higher metabolic incorporation efficiency and the versatility to deliver virtually any type of secondary reagent to the tagged biomolecule without having to synthesize and evaluate a new reporter. The TMM reporters that allow two-step live-cell labeling workflows, O-AzTMM-C10 (4) and O-TCO-TMM (5), are both useful in these scenarios. TCO-tetrazine ligations, with rate constants ranging from 103-106 M−1 s−1, are the fastest known bioorthogonal reactions, making them 3-6 orders of magnitude faster than SPAAC reactions employing DBCO, which have reported rate constants of approximately 0.3 M−1 s−1. Thus, it was hypothesized that O-TCO-TMM (5), in combination with the tetrazine ligation, would give optimal cell-surface labeling. To test this, Msmeg was treated with either 4 or 5 and then reacted with DBCO-488 or tetrazine-Cy3, respectively, for incubation times ranging from 1-30 min.

O-TCO-TMM-labeled cells could be detected by tetrazine ligation with a S/N ratio of >400:1 at only 1 min (FIG. 63). O-AzTMM-C10-labeled cells could also be detected in 1 min by SPAAC, although the S/N ratio was much lower at 13:1. Interestingly, the S/N ratio for the SPAAC reaction increased moderately with time (up to 17:1), while it dropped moderately for the tetrazine reaction (down to about 300:1). Overall, O-TCO-TMM (5), in conjunction with the tetrazine ligation, is considered to be an excellent reporter for rapid two-step labeling in living systems, and it should prove useful in situations where very low concentrations of reagents are needed (e.g., in animal infection models).

The versatile synthetic intermediates (i.e., 4 and 8) and high specificity of TMM analogues for labeling mycobacteria, should allow TMM analogues to be exploited for the development of novel strategies for targeting mycobacteria with various types of chemical payload.

To determine whether FRET-TDM is activated by endogenous TDMH in mycobacteria, M. smegmatis wild type, TDMH knock-out mutant, and TDMH-overexpression strains were grown in 7H9 medium at 37° C. to an optical density (600 nm) of approximately 1.

Fluorescence turn-on was observed in all three strains versus the no-lysate control (purple). However, the significant decrease of signal in the knock-out mutant (green) compared to wild-type M. smegmatis indicates that endogenous levels of TDMH indeed activate FRET-TDM. Because fluorescence signal was not completely reduced to the control level in the knock-out mutant, it is likely that other mechanisms for FRET-TDM activation exist in M. smegmatis (it is notable that this is not the case in E. coli, as shown in FIG. 52). Finally, an M. smegmatis strain engineered to overexpress TDMH (blue) had very strong fluorescence compared to wild-type, showing that FRET-TDM activation can be dependent upon the level of TDMH.

5389,"The data indicate that FRET-TDM can be activated in a TDMH-dependent manner in complex samples (including lysates and whole, live cells). Given the specificity of TDMH to mycobacteria, this capability may serve as a method for the rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis of mycobacterial infections, for instance by sputum smear microscopy. The lack of background signal in E. coli lysate further supports the specificity of FRET-TDM for mycobacteria. Improved specificity may be obtained by developing FRET-TDM compounds bearing acyl chains that more closely resemble mycolic acids (i.e., containing alpha branches with or without beta hydroxyl groups, and potentially other modifications that are known to occur in mycolic acids), as described in this application. Enhanced sensitivity may be obtained by developing FRET-TDM compounds with optimized fluorophore/quencher pairs and distances, as described in this application. A similar approach based on a FRET-based fluorogenic TMM substrate analogue targeting mycobacteria-specific Ag85 enzymes is also possible given the described findings on Ag85 specificity for TMM analogues described in this application.

5650,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,US20180092937A1.txt,0
5651,"The role of the immune system is to protect the body from pathogens and malignant cells. However, viruses and cancer cells find ways to evade the immune system. The aim of immunotherapies is thus to initiate an antigen specific immune response or to re-activate a pre-existing response in certain cell types of the immune system against the pathogenic invaders or cancerous cells.
",0,US20180092937A1.txt,0
5652,"The immune system consists of several specialized lineages which can be roughly grouped into two arms, the innate and the adaptive immune system. For a successful immune reaction lineages from both arms have to act in concert. A major role of the innate immune system is to mount a rapid immune response against pathogens or malignant cells which, unlike the adaptive system, is not antigen specific and long lasting. In addition to the direct killing of pathogens or transformed cells, the innate immune system also activates and subsequently directs the adaptive immune system. Antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells capture and present antigens in the form of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complex to T cells in lymphoid tissues. This antigen presentation together with the secretion of certain cytokines leads to the activation and differentiation of antigen specific effector CD4 and CD8 T cells. Type I interferon (IFN) production by antigen presenting cells, and other cell types, is considered a key event in the activation of T cells as the lack of type I IFN resulted in a reduced T cell dependent immune response against viral infections or tumor cells (Zitvogel et al, Nature Reviews Immunology 15, 405-414, 2015). On the other hand, the presence of a type I IFN signature during cancer therapy is associated with increased numbers of tumor infiltrating T cells and potentially favorable clinical outcome (Sistigu et al, Nature Medicine 20, 1301-1309, 2014).
",0,US20180092937A1.txt,0
5653,"Recent studies in mice have shown that efficient secretion of type I IFN in the tumor microenvironment and the induction of a T cell dependent immune response against cancer cells depends on the presence of the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as Tmem173, MPYS, MITA, ERIS)(Woo et al, Immunity 41, 5, 830-842, 2014; Corrales et al, Cell Reports 11, 1018-1030, 2015; Deng et al, Immunity 41, 5, 843-852, 2014). The importance of the presence of type I IFN was highlighted by the fact that the deletion of STING resulted in reduced type I IFN levels in the tumor microenvironment and in a reduced anti-tumor effect in several tumor mouse models. On the other hand, the specific activation of STING resulted in an improved, antigen specific T cell immune response against cancer cells.
",0,US20180092937A1.txt,0
5654,"STING belongs to the family of nucleic acid sensors and is the adaptor for cytosolic DNA signaling. In its basal state STING exists as a dimer with its N terminal domain anchored in the ER and the C-terminal domain residing in the cytosol. Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), generated by the protein cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) are the natural ligands of STING (Ablasser et al, Nature 498, 380-384, 2013). Binding of CDNs to STING induces conformational changes which allows the binding and activation of the TANK binding kinase (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the relocalisation from the ER to perinuclear endosomes (Liu et al, Science 347, Issue 6227, 2630-1-2630-14, 2015). Phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3 and NF-kB by TBK1 results in expression of multiple cytokines including type I IFN.

5915,"Inflammation represents a group of vascular, cellular and neurological responses to trauma. Inflammation can be characterised as the movement of inflammatory cells such as monocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes into the tissues. This is usually associated with reduced endothelial barrier function and oedema into the tissues.
",0,US20180092937A1.txt,0
5916,"Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes from the blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical event propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local vascular system, the immune system, and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells which are present at the site of inflammation and is characterised by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process.
",0,US20180092937A1.txt,0
5917,"When occurring as part of an immune response to infection or as an acute response to trauma, inflammation can be beneficial and is normally self-limiting. However, inflammation can be detrimental under various conditions. This includes the production of excessive inflammation in response to infectious agents, which can lead to significant organ damage and death (for example, in the setting of sepsis).
",0,US20180092937A1.txt,0
5918,"Moreover, chronic inflammation is generally deleterious and is at the root of numerous chronic diseases, causing severe and irreversible damage to tissues. In such settings, the immune response is often directed against self-tissues (autoimmunity), although chronic responses to foreign entities can also lead to bystander damage to self-tissues. The aim of anti-inflammatory therapy is therefore to reduce this inflammation, to inhibit autoimmunity when present and to allow for the physiological process or healing and tissue repair to progress.

In one embodiment, a TLR activates a dendritic cell (DC). Toll like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that were initially identified as sensors of the innate immune system that recognize microbial pathogens. TLRs comprise a family of conserved membrane spanning molecules containing an ectodomain of leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular TIR (Toll/IL-1R) domain. TLRs recognize distinct structures in microbes, often referred to as “PAMPs” (pathogen associated molecular patterns).

In some embodiments, the mechanism of action of the therapeutic antibody is Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC is a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system actively lyses a target cell, whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies. It is one of the mechanisms through which antibodies, as part of the humoral immune response, can act to limit and contain infection. Classical ADCC is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells; macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils can also mediate ADCC.

6273,"30 mL anhydrous pyridine and 15 mL anhydrous triethylamine were added to crude 3'-TBS-imidazopyridazinon-3-D-ribofuranoside-(2'→5')-phosphorothioate-2'-TBS-adenosine-(3'→5')-phosphorothioate (INTERMEDIATE 1.8; 0.76 g). The resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to approximately 5 mL total volume, followed by simultaneous addition of triethylamine trihydrofluoride (3.590 mL, 21.7 mmol) and 11 mL anhydrous triethylamine. This solution was stirred at 50° C. for 3.5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was quenched with methoxytrimethylsilane (10 mL, 72.4 mmol) and further stirred at room temperature to consume any excess of HF. After 30 minutes, all volatile components were evaporated under reduced pressure, followed by a final co-evaporation with 50 mL anhydrous toluene under reduced pressure. The residue was further dried in vacuo to yield the raw mixture containing Example 1.1 and Example 1.2.

",0,US20200031833A1.txt,0
6959,"Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives have been described as analgesics, benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, angiogenesis inhibitors, anti-inflammatory agents, neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists, COX2-inhibitor and corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 antagonists and as CHK1 inhibitors (e.g. Mayo et al (Adv. Synth. Catal. 2003, 345, 620-624; Tellew et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2010, 20, 7259-7264); Chen et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004, 14, 3669-3673); Labroli et 2011, 21, 2641-2645); Gilligan et al, (J. Med. Chem. 2009, 52, 3073-3083); He et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,124 B1); and Wren et al. (WO 2010/086040), Catalano et al (Tetrahedron Lett. 2015, 56, 6077-6079). The pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine scaffold has also been described in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) inhibitors. Bianco et al (PLoS Pathogens, 2012, 8(3), 1-17) and LaMarche et al (Antimicr. Agents and Chemother. 2012, 56(10), 5149-5156) have shown that PI4K is important for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and Yang et al (J. Biol. Chem. 2012, 287(11), 8547-8467) have shown the same for coronavirus. Gudmundsson et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2009, 19, 5689-5692) have disclosed some 3-arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines with potent activity against herpes virus. Hwang et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012, 22, 7297-7301) have described 3-arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines as PI4K inhibitors that have anti-HCV effects. In WO 2015/110491 some further pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives are described as PI4KIIIβ inhibitors having an antiviral activity. Pyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazine derivatives have been described as corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 (CRF1) antagonists which may be potential anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs (cf. for example, Gilligan et al (J. Med. Chem. 2009, 52, 3073-3083). Pexacerfont is a clinically tested pyrazolo[1,5-a]triazin-4-amine drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, acting as a CRF-1 antagonist. The pyrazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazine scaffold has also been described as present in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (WO2013128029), casein kinase inhibitors and DYRK1A kinase inhibitors (WO2010103486) useful for treatment of various diseases. The scaffold has further been described as present in cannabinoid 1 receptor antagonists (J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. (2010), 335(1), 103-113). Pyrazolo[1,5-a]triazin-4-amines have been described as PI4K inhibitors with antiviral potency in Mejdrova et al (J. Med. Chem., 2015, 58 (9), 3767-3793), and in Mejdrova et al (J. Med. Chem., 2017, 60 (1), 100-118). In WO2016206999 some further pyrazolo[1,5-a]triazine derivatives are described as PI4KIIIβ inhibitors having an antiviral activity.

Similar scaffolds have been described as present in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) inhibitors (McLeod et al (ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2013, 4(7), 585-589) and van der Schaar et al (Antimicrobial Agents Chemother. 2013, 57(10), 4971-4981), and inhibitors of PI4K have been shown to be potent antivirals (Bianco et al, PLoS Pathogens, 2012, 8(3), 1-17; LaMarche et al, Antimicr.

6961,"Décor et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2013, 23, 3841-7) have also shown that PI4K is important for enterovirus replication. However, they have also shown that PI4K inhibitors (non 3-arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines) and the 3-arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2,5-dimethyl-N-(2-morpholinoethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-amine (called T-00127-HEV1) when tested in-vivo induced mortality in mice, which raised doubts on the safety of inhibiting PI4K. Sala et al (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2016, 26(11), 2706-12) have published several analogs based on the PI4KIIIβ inhibitor T-00127-HEV1. The authors made a number of analogs with modifications in the central rings of the compounds.

6962,"Autophagy is a process of homeostatic degradation in cells, used to create nutrients in times of stress and as a mechanism to recycle damaged organelles or microbes in the cytostol (Karanasios et al, 2016, Autophagy at the cell, tissue and organismal level (Springer)). Many pathogens interact with the host autophagic pathways and could impair the normal autophagy. Lai et al (Viruses, 2016, 8(32), 1-13) describe that viruses subvert the autophagy machinery to benefit the virus replication and exit from the host and that inhibition of PI4KIIIβ will have an effect on the autophagy processes and thus inhibit the virus replication. Sridhar et al (EMBO J. 2013, 32, 324-339) describe PI4KIIIβ to be a key factor in autophagy and it is believed that many diseases are caused by or linked to impaired or abnormal autophagy, for example neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, cancer, cardiac diseases, inflammatory diseases and diabetes (Polajnar et al J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2014, 9(18). 1705-1711; Levine et al, Cell, 2008, 132(1), 27-42; Barlow, et al, DNA Cell. Biol, 2015, 34(4), 252-260). Without being bound to any theory it is believed that compounds of the present invention also could be used for treatment of diseases caused by or linked to impaired or abnormal autophagy.

",0,US20200031833A1.txt,0
7519,"Cells were cultivated on 96-well flat bottom plates to approximately 90% confluence (20 000-90 000 cells/well) in a suitable media. The titer of the virus was determined by the standard method of tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) on cells. Briefly, cells were infected with 50 μl of virus suspension, and diluted 10-fold in media. The plates were incubated in 37° C. with 5% CO2 for 3-7 days and cells were inspected daily for CPE. After determining CPE, plates were stained with Gram's Crystal Violet solution and optical density was read at 540 nm. The highest virus dilution that resulted in >95% CPE was used in the assays. Substances at a final concentration of 0.1 nM-1 μM and the virus were added to the cells and incubated for 3-7 days depending on the virus and cell line used. As controls, uninfected cells and cells infected with virus (no substance) were included on each plate. The cells were stained with crystal violet after determining the CPE on infected controls and the optical density was read at 540 nm. The inhibition capacity was calculated as a % by comparison with non-infected and infected controls.

7595,"Inhibition of PI4 kinases was studied using the ADP-Glo™ Kinase Assay which is a luminescent kinase assay that measures ADP formed from a kinase reaction, wherein ADP is converted into ATP, which is converted into light by Ultra-Glo™ Luciferase. The assay is performed in two steps; first, after the kinase reaction, an equal volume of ADP-Glo™ Reagent is added to terminate the kinase reaction and deplete the remaining ATP. In the second step, the Kinase Detection Reagent is added, which simultaneously converts ADP to ATP and allows the newly synthesized ATP to be measured using a coupled luciferase/luciferin reaction. The luminescent signal produced is proportional to the activity of the kinase Inhibition of PI3 kinases was studied using the HTRF (homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence) assay, which is a universal method for identifying and characterizing the phosphotransferase activity induced by any ATP/ADP dependent target. The formation of ADP was detected by a specific monoclonal antibody labeled with Eu3+ cryptate, and directly correlated with the amount of phosphorylated substrate. Table 8 shows test results for some compounds of the invention vs. different kinases, expressed as IC50 values (in μM).

The animals were euthanized and organs were collected for pancreatitis evaluation by histopathology and for virus titer determination by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pancreata were obtained from infected and uninfected control animals and from animals treated with 4 different dosages of Example 8, and HE-stained slides of the organs were prepared, studied and scored for signs of inflammation and necrosis on a scale from 0 to 3, as follows: 0=no abnormalities. 1=slight inflammation and/or single cell foci in exocrine pancreas. 2=moderate inflammation and/or several foci with necrosis in exocrine pancreas. 3=severe inflammation and/or large areas of necrosis in exocrine pancreas (FIG. 3). The virus titer in the organs was determined by immunohistochemistry using the Dako 5-D8/1 monoclonal mouse antibody and the titer was scored on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates no infection and 4 corresponds to the highest determined virus titer (FIG. 4).

7678,"As stimulated by the clinical success of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin), a platinum(II) complex, for the treatment of cancers, scientists have paid great attention to the development of metal-based anticancer drugs which target DNA including the cisplatin analogues and some ruthenium(II)-arene complexes [Sadler, P. J. et al. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008, 12, 197]. However, severe side effects and the induced drug resistance are commonly encountered and thus subsequently have hampered the wider applications of these DNA binding agents.

7679,"Cisplatin and its derivatives are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents for treating cancer. Yet, most of them fail in combating with metastatic cancer, which is a big problem found in cancer treatment. In view of this, it is important to develop new cytotoxic agents that can at the same time regulate tumor microenvironment which is important for governing tumor progression, growth, angiogenesis and metastasis.

7699,"Provided herein is a new series of dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic platinum(II) complexes with N-heterocylic carbene (NHC) and 1,3-bis(2-pyridylimino)isoindoline (BPI) ligands. The NHC ligand is found to be perpendicular to the plane of BPI ligand, as revealed by X-ray crystallography, thus allowing these platinum(II) complexes to target other biomolecules rather than DNA only. The introduction of NHC ligand, which is a strong σ-donor, also renders the complexes strong luminescence in aqueous solution and live cells, and hence their subcellular localization in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be identified by fluorescence microscopy. With their accumulation in ER, they are found to induce ER stress and subsequent apoptotic cell death, accounting for their potent cytotoxicity toward cancer cells.

7701,"Platinum(II) compounds as exemplified by cisplatin and its derivatives have been widely used in the treatment of cancer.[1,2] Their mechanism of action is mainly through covalent crosslinking onto DNA, leading to cancer cell apoptosis or cell cycle arrest.[3,4] Since DNA is the primary molecular target, cancer cells with changes in repair of DNA lesion, such as enhanced nucleotide excision repair or deficiency in mismatch repair, are found to show resistance to these platinum drugs.[5] Moreover, these platinum drugs generally give rise to severe toxic side effects, probably due to the fact that DNA is not a specific biomolecule in cancer cells.[5] As a result, there are continuing efforts on searching metal complexes with new working mechanisms.
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7702,"It should be advantageous for developing anticancer drugs to target tumor microenvironment. Tumor microenvironment is complex and dynamic, and is regulated by a number of mediators and signaling transduction pathways that govern tumor progression including tumor initiation, growth, angiogenesis and metastasis.[6,7] For example, tumor cells developing their microenvironment by secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or cytokines to promote abnormal tumor neovasculature formation, which provides nutrients for further tumor growth and metastasis.[8,9] In addition, binding of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) to uPA receptor (uPAR) in tumor microenvironment can trigger activation of metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade the components of surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM),[10] and hence contributes to tumor cell metastasis. Together with the fact that over 90% of cancer deaths today are due to metastasis formation,[11] regulations of tumor microenvironment including inhibition of tumor growth, metastasis and VEGF-induced angiogenesis, have been considered as effective means in combating tumor progression.[12,13]
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7703,"A number of metal complexes have been reported to target tumor microenvironment by acting as angiogenesis inhibitors.[14-16] Notably, a ruthenium(III) complex, NAMI-A, was found to be non-cytotoxic toward solid tumor but show promising antitumor activities by inhibition of tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.[14] In addition, platinum complexes showing dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic properties have also been explored,[17-19] and they should show improved anticancer efficacy through decreasing acquired-drug resistance and systemic toxicities, as compared to that of a cytotoxic or an anti-angiogenic agent alone.[20,21] However, none of them exhibited promising in vivo antitumor and anti-angiogenic activities.

Provided is an out-of-plane ancillary ligand to the platinum(II) center for targeting biomolecules other than DNA in order to achieve dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic properties. NHC is a strong G-donor and can increase the energy level of non-emissive ligand-field (LF) state, rendering platinum(II) complexes strongly luminescent,[24] and this strong luminescence feature can help to elucidate mechanism of anticancer actions of the complexes by fluorescence microscopy.

7890,"As compared with the chloro-precursor complex [Pt(BPI)Cl] (1i), both the absorption and emission spectra of platinum(II) complexes with NHC ligands (1b and 1j) displayed distinct blue-shifts (FIG. 3). With reference to previous spectroscopic work on related platinum(II) complexes,[26] the observed blue-shifts in [Pt(BPI)(NHC)]+ were probably attributed to an enhanced contribution from the 3IL state and a reduced 3MLCT character. On the other hand, 1j, which has an extended π-conjugation through benzannulation of the pincer ligand, showed blue-shift in both the absorption and emission spectra, as compared to that of 1f (Table 2 and 3). This can be rationalized by destabilization of the LUMO with successive expansion of the π-system of the pyrrolate moieties, as supported by similar finding reported previously.[27]

7891,"Interestingly, in one embodiment, proteomics data and in vitro biochemical assays at sub-cytotoxic concentrations reveal that a representative complex, 1b, can regulate uPA/uPAR-mediated and VEGF-induced angiogenic pathways. Ex vivo anti-angiogenic properties of 1b is further demonstrated by chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. More importantly, treatment of nude mice bearing highly metastatic MDA-MB231 xenograft by 1b show significant reduction in tumor volume. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues from treated mice supports the promising in vivo antitumor as well as anti-angiogenic activities of 1b, while blood biochemistry reveal minimal systemic toxicity found in the treated mice. All of these results indicate that these dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic platinum(II) complexes are useful for treating cancer, including non-curable highly metastatic cancer.
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7892,"The luminescence properties of [Pt(BPI)(NHC)]+ in live cells were also examined. After treating human cervical epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cells with 1b (5 μM) for 15 min, a strong green luminescence was observed from cytoplasm of the cells (FIG. 4(A)), demonstrating the readiness of monitoring cellular uptake and localization of 1b by its strong luminescence in vitro. The exact subcellular location of 1b was investigated by co-staining with organelle-specific probes. It was noted that 1b specifically localized in ER, as supported by high Pearson's correlation coefficient for co-localization between 1b and ER-Tracker™ (0.83; FIG. 4(A)). Control experiment showed that there was no background signal in the rhodamine and FITC channel when the cells were treated by 1b and ER-Tracker™ respectively (FIG. 5). In addition, no significant co-localization between 1b and mitochondria-specific Mitotracker® or lysosome-specific Lysotracker® was observed (Pearson's correlation coefficient=0.45 and 0.55 respectively; FIG. 6), indicating that 1b was preferentially accumulated in ER of HeLa cells

7893,"In view of the enormous success of platinum(II) compounds for anti-cancer treatment,[28] in vitro cytotoxicity of [Pt(BPI)(NHC)]+ towards various cancer cell lines including HeLa, colon carcinoma (HCT116), lung cancer (NCI-H460) and highly invasive triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), as well as non-tumorigenic immortalized human hepatocyte (MIHA) were examined. 1a-1h were cytotoxic against the cancer cells with IC50 (dose required to inhibit 50% of cellular growth) ranging from 0.14±0.01 to 18.21±1.52 μM after 72 h treatment. They were found to be more potent in killing most of the cancer cells investigated than cisplatin (11.75±1.36 to 77.19±7.82 μM). Among these platinum(II) complexes, 1b displayed relatively higher cytotoxicity towards NCI-H460 and HCT116 cells than that towards non-tumorigenic MIHA cells (16- and 19-fold difference in IC50 values respectively; Table 4), suggesting its selectivity on killing cancer cells over non-tumorigenic cells. As a result, 1b was selected as a target compound and its anti-cancer properties were further investigated.

7916,"Since 1b was found to accumulate in ER domain as revealed by confocal fluorescence microscopy images (FIG. 4(A)), this prompted us to investigate any ER stress induced by 1b that accounted for its high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. Western blotting analysis showed a significant up-regulation of phosphorylated RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) upon treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 1b (5 uM) for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h (FIG. 4(B)). Also, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were also found to be stimulated under same conditions, suggesting that 1b could induce ER stress.[29,30]

7917,"In addition to ER stress, apoptosis-related protein such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspases 3 and 9 were cleaved in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 1b for 48 h (FIG. 4(C)), indicative of cell apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 1b for 24 h revealed a marked accumulation in the G0/G1 phase from 36.4% to 64% (FIG. 7(B)). The G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest was associated with stimulation of p15 expression and down-regulation of cyclin D1/D3 and CDK 4/6, as indicated by western blot analysis (FIG. 7(C)). In addition, there was dose-dependent increase (up to 8-fold) of cell population in sub-G1 phase (FIG. 7(A)), and this was a hallmark of apoptosis owing to DNA fragmentation. On the other hand, JC1 staining[31] of cells treated with 1b showed a decrease in ratios of orange to green fluorescence (1580/1530) with increasing dosage of 1b (FIGS. 8(A)-(D)). This indicated that 1b could induce mitochondria dysfunction. Collectively, in vitro assays confirm that 1b at its cytotoxic concentrations could induce ER stress, nuclear fragmentation and mitochondria dysfunction, leading to subsequent apoptotic events.

7918,"To obtain a holistic insight into the mechanism of action of 1b, proteomic analysis on 1b-treated MDA-MB-231 cells was performed using HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS. A bioinformatics analysis of the proteomic data showed that CHIP (c-terminal Hsp70-interacting protein), c-Kit and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein pathway were one of the most predominantly modulated pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 1b (5 μM) for 5 h with high statistical significance (Table 5). Interestingly, these three pathways were related to angiogenic responses of cancer cells. The expression level of CHIP is negatively correlated with VEGFR2 which is an important receptor for initiation of angiogenesis;[32] Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein is capable of suppressing tumor growth through down-regulation of a number of angiogenic factors;[33] c-kit receptor regulate angiogenesis by PI3K/Akt downstream signaling pathway.[34]

7919,"In view of the regulation of angiogenesis-related pathways by 1b as identified by proteomic data, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic properties of 1b were evaluated. Wound closure assays showed that 1b effectively inhibited migration of MDA-MB-231 cells at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (0.25-1 μM) after a 24 h treatment in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (FIGS. 9(A) and 9(B), and 10); this effect was not due to the cytotoxicity of 1b as the cells were found to have insignificant growth inhibition under these concentrations of 1b (FIG. 11). On the other hand, transwell invasive assays revealed significant inhibition of invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by 1b at its sub-cytotoxic concentrations after 24 h treatment (FIGS. 9(C) and (D)). In tube formation assay, 1b displayed significant inhibition on the angiogenesis of MS1 cells, as indicated by the loss of ability of the endothelial cells to form three-dimensional tube-like structures after treatment with 1b for 3 h at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (>90% cells remained viable; FIGS. 12(A)-(B)). All these data suggest that 1b not only can induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at its cytotoxic concentrations, but also can inhibit metastasis of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 at its sub-cytotoxic concentrations.

7935,"To gain better insight into the anti-angiogenic properties of 1b, effects of 1b on uPA/uPAR system were first investigated, as this system has been found to play crucial roles in growth, metastasis and angiogenesis of many solid malignancies, e.g. by activation of MMPs for ECM degradation and triggering downstream intracellular signaling for metastasis.[10,35] Western blotting experiments showed that the expression level of uPA and MMP-9 (examples of MMPs) decreased significantly when MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with increasing concentration of 1b (FIG. 13(A)) or increasing incubation time of 1b (FIG. 13(B)). In contrast, the expression of TIMP-1, a tissue inhibitor of MMPs,[36] moderately increased after treatment with 1b (FIG. 13(A)). These results suggests that 1b could slow down uPA/uPAR-mediated ECM proteolysis process, thus inhibiting tumor progression.
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7936,"In addition to the regulation of proteolysis, 1b was found to significantly suppress phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at the site of Tyr397, and moderately inhibited levels of phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr925 and Tyr576/577, while exhibited little effect on total protein level of FAK (FIGS. 13(C) and (D)). Moreover, 1b significantly inhibited phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in a dose- and time-dependent manner (FIGS. 13(C) and (D)). PI3K/Akt[37] and Ras/MEK/ERK[38] protein kinase pathways have been reported to be downstream signaling pathways after stimulation of FAK upon formation of integrin and uPAR complex, and these pathways can facilitate cell invasion and proliferation. Notably, PI3K/Akt pathway is also the downstream signaling pathway of c-kit receptor which was identified as one of the predominantly modulated pathways in proteomic studies of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 1b.
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7937,"The effects of 1b, LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor)[39] and U0126 (ERK inhibitor)[40] on PI3K and ERK signaling pathways were further investigated. LY294002, U0126 or 1b alone displayed insignificant cell growth inhibitory effects (1b is at sub-cytotoxic concentration; FIG. 13(E)), but notable inhibition on the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells (FIGS. 13(F) and (G)). Co-treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 1b, and LY294002 or U0126, was found to inhibit cell growth, migration and invasion significantly (FIGS. 13(E), (F) and (G)). All these data indicate the anti-angiogenic properties of 1b by inhibiting uPA/uPAR-mediated ECM proteolysis and downstream intracellular signaling for metastasis.

7938,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is another critical mediator of angiogenesis and regulates most of the steps in angiogenic cascade, including proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells.[41,42] Previous studies demonstrated that MMP-9 and uPA were able to facilitate degradation of ECM, leading to release or activation of VEGF, thus promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis.[43-45] Therefore, effect of 1b on secretion level of VEGF in the culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by Quantikine® ELISA kit. It was found that VEGF secretion level was reduced by 50% upon treating MDA-MB-231 cells with 1b for 24 h, as compared to the untreated cells (FIG. 14(A)).
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7939,"To further validate anti-angiogenic properties of 1b, effects of 1b on another aggressive cell line, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line, were studied. HUVEC is a well-established cell line for studying angiogenesis.[46] It was found that exposure of HUVECs to VEGF (50 ng/mL) lead to promoted cell growth, migration, invasion and tube formation (FIGS. 14(B)-(D)). In order to mimic the tumor microenvironment in vitro, the conditioned media (CM) of MDA-MB-231 cells containing VEGF (13.4 ng/mL) was collected for incubation of HUVECs. As shown in FIGS. 14(B)-14(E), 1b significantly suppressed CM-mediated migration, invasion and tube formation of HUVECs at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. More interestingly, chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay[43] showed effective ex vivo anti-angiogenic properties of 1b (FIG. 14(F)). Taken together, these results demonstrate that 1b not only can inhibit VEGF secretion from tumor cells, but also suppress VEGF-mediated angiogenesis.

7940,"With the promising dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic properties of 1b, in vivo antitumor activity of 1b was investigated. Treatment of nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts with 1b through intravenous injection once per two days resulted in a significant growth inhibition by 81 and 64% at concentration of 5 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg respectively, as compared to mice treated with solvent control (both with p<0.01; FIG. 15(A)). Importantly, 1b did not cause any death or body weight loss of mice during the treatment (FIG. 15(B)). Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues from treated mice revealed decrease in expression of Ki67 as compared to those from control mice, suggesting the promising anti-proliferation effect of 1b (FIG. 15(C)). In addition, higher levels of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation (as shown by TUNEL assay) were found in tumor tissues of treated mice, demonstrating the effective killing of cancer cells by 1b in vivo (FIG. 15(C)). More interestingly, CD34 staining, which can serve as marker for in vivo angiogenesis,[44] showed significant inhibition of blood vessel formation in tumors of treated mice (FIG. 15(C)). Taken together, 1b should be the first platinum(II) compound, according to the best of our knowledge, showing anti-proliferation, anticancer and anti-angiogenic effects in vivo.

7941,"As a promising candidate for treating cancer in vivo, we further investigate systemic toxicity from 1b. Blood biochemistry of nude mice after treatment with 1b (5 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg) showed low systemic toxicity of 1b (FIGS. 15(D)-(H)); plasma levels of several organ damage indicators including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK) and blood fat (CHOL) of the treated mice were lower than those of the untreated mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts (p<0.05; FIGS. 15(D), (E), (F)), fell within the statistically relevant range of those of mice without the xenografts. On the other hand, treated mice showed higher level of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and blood glucose (GLU) level than untreated mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts (FIGS. 15(G), (H)), suggesting that the treatment helped to recover the BUN and GLU level to almost healthy level.

7943,"Disclosed herein are dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic compounds should be new candidates for treating aggressive and highly metastatic cancers which are almost non-curable in this moment. Although platinum(II) compounds are known for their good potency in killing cancer cells, it is quite surprising that anti-angiogenic platinum(II) compounds are less well known and none of the reported platinum(II) compounds demonstrate dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic activities in vivo. This can be due to the strong binding of square-planar platinum(II) compounds onto DNA, thus they show less tendency to interact with other biomolecules in tumor microenvironment and hence they are not anti-angiogenic. In order to target other biomolecules, NHC ligands were introduced onto the complexes in order to weaken the interactions of the complexes with DNA by the out-of-plane NHC ligands. Proteomics data and in vitro biochemical assays indicate significant effect of 1b on uPA/uPAR- and VEGF-mediated signaling pathway, further suggesting that 1b can likely interact with biomolecules in tumor microenvironment.
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7944,"In addition, since NHC is a strong G-donor and can increase the energy level of non-emissive ligand-field (LF) state, the platinum(II) NHC complexes are strongly luminescent and displaying vibronic structured emission spectra upon photo excitation.[24] Due to their luminescence properties, cellular distribution of the complexes can be examined by confocal fluorescence spectroscopy. 1b is found to preferentially accumulate in ER domain of HeLa cells and this information helped us to unravel the mechanism of action of these anticancer complexes: induction of ER stress and subsequent apoptotic cell death. Also, it is conceivable that such strong luminescence can render the metal complexes being both diagnostic and therapeutic agents, i.e. theranostics, and hence real-time monitoring of treatment by the complexes can be feasible.
",0,US20200048291A1.txt,0
7945,"The promising in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities of this class of platinum(II) complexes are attributable to their dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic properties. Their high cytotoxicity against a panel of cancer cells, including highly metastatic MDA-MB-231, can be explained by induction of ER stress, as supported by up regulation of phosphorylated RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in western blotting analysis. In addition, DNA fragmentation and mitochondria dysfunction are found in the treated cells, as shown by G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and increase of cell population in sub-G1 phase, and JC1 staining assay respectively. On the other hand, the anti-angiogenic properties of the complexes are first revealed by proteomic analysis on 1b-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, showing that CHIP, c-Kit and VHL protein pathway are the most predominantly modulated pathways and they are all closely related to angiogenic responses of cancer cells. The involvement of 1b in regulation of angiogenesis is further supported by western blotting and in vitro experiments including wound closure assay, transwell invasive and tube formation assay. More importantly, 1b demonstrates excellent ex vivo and in vivo anti-angiogenic properties in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues from treated mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenograft, respectively. Taken together, treatment of mice bearing highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 xenograft by 1b results in remarkable inhibition of tumor growth, and anti-proliferation and anticancer effects as found in immunohistochemical analysis. Interestingly, there is no significant loss in body weight or death of mice throughout the treatment and blood biochemistry indicates low systemic toxicity of 1b, further demonstrating the potential of this class of [Pt(BPI)(NHC)]+ complexes for treating highly metastatic cancers. The promising dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic effects in vivo should be firstly found in platinum(II) compounds, according to the best of our knowledge, and the unique chemical structure of the complexes with out-of-plane NHC ligands for prohibiting strong interactions with DNA can probably accounted for the dual properties.

7946,"Dual cytotoxic and anti-angiogenic [Pt(BPI)(NHC)](OTf) were synthesized and characterized. They were cytotoxic against various cancer cells, and this was ascribed to apoptotic cell death induced by ER-stress, mitochondria dysfunction and cell cycle arrest. Proteomic data indicated regulation of angiogenesis by the platinum(II) complexes. Such unique feature allows these complexes to slow down extracellular matrix proteolysis process by inhibiting uPA and MMP expressions. Also, this could inhibit downstream signaling pathways of uPA/uPAR and protect native VEGF from cleavage, thereby accounting for the promising in vitro and ex vivo anti-angiogenic properties of the complexes (FIG. 16). Significant inhibition of in vivo tumor growth in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts by 1b was also demonstrated, with minimal systemic toxicity found as indicated by blood biochemistry. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues from treated mice revealed promising anti-proliferation, anticancer and anti-angiogenic effects of 1b in vivo.

8047,"As a common functional group, an amide bond is widely present in natural products such as proteins and synthetic compounds. It is generally believed that the resonance stability of the amide bond makes the amide a weak electrophile (The structure of proteins: two hydrogenbonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1951, 37, 205), accordingly, it is difficult to selectively open the C—N bond of the amide by chemical synthesis (Conversion of amides to esters by the nickel-catalysed activation of amide C—N bonds.

8048,"—CONHArF (ArF=p-CF3C6F4) is an excellent amide-guiding group and has a wide range of applications in various types of β-C—H activation reactions, but its disadvantage is that for certain substrates, the guiding group is difficult to remove (Ligand-Enabled β-C—H Arylation of α-Amino Acids Using a Simple and Practical Auxiliary. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 3338). This greatly limits the further conversion utilization of these C—H activation products, so it is necessary to develop a universal method for removing the guiding group.
",0,US20200055807A1.txt,0
8049,"Existing methods for removing the guiding group: 1. heating a strong alkali aqueous solution to hydrolyze the amide to a carboxylic acid; 2. heating a strong acid to hydrolyze the amide to a carboxylic acid; 3. adding NaNO2 in a mixed solvent Ac2O/AcOH to obtain a carboxylic acid; 4. obtaining by heating BF3.Et2O in methanol; 5. forming an ester through Hydrolysis by stepwise reaction of LiHMDS/MeOCOCl/MeONa.

8050,"For the above method of using BF3.Et2O, the reaction is carried out at 100° C. to achieve alcoholysis of the guiding group, and the method has the disadvantages of expensive reagents, complicated operation and harsh reaction conditions. The remaining methods described above require strong acid or strong base conditions and many functional groups are not stable under these conditions. Moreover, the above methods are all obviously affected by the substrate steric hindrance, and the substrate has a small application range.

8074,"When studying removal of the guiding group from the amide compound, the inventor of the present application has unexpectedly discovered that the use of an alcohol solution of an epoxy compound under alkaline conditions can promote the conversion of an amide to an ester, and an amide N—H with a certain acidity nucleophilically attacks an open loop of the activated alkylene oxide under alkaline conditions to form an N-addition transition state product. The transition state is unstable. After the oxygen anion generated in situ nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl group of the amide bond upon opening of the loop of the alkylene oxide, the C—N bond of the amide group is broken, and the amide alcoholysis reaction is completed.

8089,"The following is a description of the above reaction principle using KOAc as the pH adjuster and ethanol as the solvent. An amide N—H with a certain acidity nucleophilically attacks an open loop of the alkylene oxide activated by potassium ion under the action of KOAc to form an N-addition transition state product. The transition state is unstable. After the oxygen anion generated in situ nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl group of the amide bond upon opening of the loop of the alkylene oxide, the C—N bond of the amide group is broken to form an esterification intermediate product, and then the esterification intermediate and the alcohol solvent undergo a transesterification reaction to generate a final amide alcoholysis product.

Each of the materials used in the above process is a conventional material and therefore does not increase the cost for implementing the method of the present application. Moreover, the above process is a conventional operation in the purification process and therefore does not increase the complexity of the method of the present application. Further, controlling the pH value of the mixture at 3.5 to 4.5 at the time of extraction is beneficial to improving the extraction separation efficiency. For example, the pH value is adjusted to be acidic, such that the secondary amine structure on the leaving group is salted, the water solubility of the leaving group is enhanced, and by-products of the leaving group are easy to remove by washing. Strong acidity may deteriorate other functional groups on the product, and result in waste of the reagent. or, after completion of the alcoholysis, preferably the method further comprises: removing the solvent of the alcoholysis product under reduced pressure to obtain a residue; purifying the residue by silica gel column chromatography. This process is suitable for product separation in small batch trials of a laboratory.

8434,"The non-selective NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, (racemic as well as the S enantiomer), a medication mainly used for starting and maintaining anaesthesia, has demonstrated over the last years clinical efficacy in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) at subanaesthetic doses (Murrough et al. 2013, Am J Psychiatry. 170: 1134; Singh et al. 2016, Biol Psychiatry. 80: 424). More precisely, ketamine elicits a rapid onset of efficacy which lasts several days in MDD patients insufficiently responding to standard drug therapy (Berman et al. 2000. Biol Psychiatry 47:351, Serafini et al. 2014. Curr. Neuropharmacol. 12:444). However, non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists have a range of undesirable effects which limit their application. In particular dissociative and psychogenic side effects are prominent for the non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine (Krystal et al. 1994. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 51:199). In the early 1990s, it was found that multiple NMDA receptor subtypes exist, which contain different NR2(A-D) subunits (Paoletti et al., 2013 Nat Rev. Neurosci 14:383). More recently, NR2B subtype selective NMDA receptor negative allosteric modulators (NR2B NAM) have raised interest and have shown potential in a wide range of clinical indications, such as attention, emotion, mood, and pain, as well as being involved in a number of different human disorders (Mony et. al. 2009. Br. J. Pharmacol. 157:1301; Chaffey et al., Current Anaesthesia & Critical Care 19, 183). In particular, NR2B NAM have also demonstrated antidepressant efficacy in the early stage of clinical trials (Preskorn et al. 2008. J Clin Psychopharmacol 70:58). Preclinical studies using NR2B NAM as well as applying various transgenic mice strains have shown that NR2B containing NMDA-receptors are mediating the positive effect of ketamine in e.g. the Forced Swim Test (Miller et al. 2014 eLife 3:e03581; Kiselycznyk et al. 2015, Behav Brain Res, 287:89). Furthermore, selective NR2B NAM have advantages over unselective NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, due to greatly diminished dissociative and psychotomimetic side effects (Jimenez-Sanchez et al. 2014. Neuropsychopharmacology 39:2673). NR2B NAM described to date have exhibited drawbacks with regard to their receptor pharmacology and/or to other drug properties which have limited potential use in human drug therapy (Taylor, et al., 2006, Clin Pharmacokinet. 45: 989; Addy et al. 2009 J of Clinical Pharmacology 49:856)).

The compounds of the present invention differ structurally from the examples 100, 105, 106 and 107 explicitly disclosed in WO2015/130905 in that they contain a para-disubstituted pyrazinyl substructure in place of the meta-disubstituted phenyl ring.

8449,"Further, the compounds of the present invention show good membrane permeability and no in vitro efflux (see table 5 for MDCK assay MDR1 (P-gp)). Therefore, compounds of the present invention are expected to show a favorable brain penetration which is required for efficacious CNS medicaments.

8450,"The MDCK assays provide information on the potential of a compound to pass the blood brain barrier. Permeability measurements across polarized, confluent MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers grown on permeable filter supports are used as an in vitro absorption model: apparent permeability coefficients (PE) of the compounds across the MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers are measured (pH 7.4, 37° C.) in apical-to-basal (AB) and basal-to-apical (BA) transport direction. The AB permeability (PEAB) represents drug absorption from the blood into the brain and the BA permeability (PEBA) drug efflux from the brain back into the blood via both, passive permeability as well as active transport mechanisms mediated by efflux and uptake transporters that are expressed on the MDCK-MDR1 cells, predominantly by the overexpressed human MDR1. Identical or similar permeabilities in both transport directions indicate passive permeation (PEBA/PEAB≤1), vectorial permeability points to additional active transport mechanisms. Higher PEBA than PEAB (PEBA/PEAB>5) indicates the involvement of active efflux mediated by MDR1, which might compromise the goal to achieve sufficient brain exposure. Therefore, this assay provides valuable support for selection of compounds applicable for further in vivo testing. High permeability not limited by efflux at the blood brain barrier is a favourable characteristic for compounds that are to be used for drugs acting primarily in the CNS.

8467,"Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of pyrazine derivatives of general formula A. The first step is a nucleophilic substitution of a substituted phenol derivate R2-OH and 5-chloropyrazine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester; the ester group is reduced to the corresponding alcohol with NaBH4; the hydroxy group is then converted into a leaving group (e.g. mesylate).

Chemical shifts are given in parts per million (ppm) downfield from internal reference trimethylsilane in 6 units. Selected data are reported in the following manner: chemical shift, multiplicity, coupling constants (J), integration. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out using Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates. All compounds were visualized as single spots using short wave UV light. Low resolution mass spectra were obtained using a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer (LCMS) that consisted of an Agilent 1100 series LC coupled to a Agilent 6130 quadrupole mass spectrometer (electrospray positive ionization).

9195,"The present invention relates to a newly developed butane-tetraol-based amphiphilic compound, a method of preparing the same, and a method of extracting, solubilizing, stabilizing, crystallizing or analyzing a membrane protein using the amphiphilic compound.

9197,"Membrane proteins play an important role in biological systems. Because these bio-macromolecules include hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, amphiphilic molecules are required to extract membrane proteins from cell membranes and solubilize and stabilize the membrane proteins in an aqueous solution.
",0,US20200123187A1.txt,0
9198,"High-quality crystals of a membrane protein should be obtained to analyze a structure of the membrane protein. For this purpose, the structural stability of the membrane protein in the aqueous solution should take precedence. There are over one hundred conventional amphiphilic molecules that have been used for membrane protein research. However, among these, five amphiphilic molecules have been actively used to conduct research on the structure of the membrane protein. The five amphiprotic molecules include n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (OG), n-nonyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (NG), n-decyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DM), n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM), and lauryldimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) (S. Newstead et al., Protein Sci. 17 (2008) 466-472., Newstead et al., Mol. Membr. Biol. 25 (2008) 631-638.). However, since many membrane proteins surrounded by these molecules tend to be easily structurally denatured or condensed to rapidly lose their functions, there are many limitations in research on the function and structure of the membrane protein using these molecules. This is because the conventional molecules exhibit various characteristics due to their simple chemical structures. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel amphiprotic materials having new excellent characteristics through novel structures.
",0,US20200123187A1.txt,0
9199,"Meanwhile, high-quality crystals of a membrane protein should be obtained to analyze the structure of the membrane proteins. For this purpose, the structural stability of the membrane protein in the aqueous solution should take precedence. So far, there is no research on the membrane protein conducted using an amphiphilic stereoisomer. However, since the proteins themselves exhibit chirality, and micelles having a self-assembled structure of an amphiphilic molecule have greatly varying characteristics due to the chirality of the amphiphilic molecule as a component, the chirality of the amphiphilic molecule is considered to play an important role in stabilization and crystallization of the membrane protein.

9200,"Accordingly, the present inventors have developed an amphiphilic compound as a chiral stereoisomer by introducing a hydrophobic group and a hydrophilic group to a central structure exhibiting chirality, and confirmed an activity of the compound to stabilize the membrane protein.

However, when the concentration of the amphiphilic molecules is greater than or equal to any critical micelle concentration (CMC), round or oval micelles in which the hydrophobic groups aggregate inside and the hydrophilic groups are exposed on surfaces of the micelles may be formed due to hydrophobic interactions, resulting in significantly increased solubility in water.

",0,US20200123187A1.txt,0
9396,"The structures of BTMs were distinct in terms of the stereochemistry in a linker region (FIG. 3). The design of BTMs has a characteristic in that two alkyl chains and two dimaltoside hydrophilic groups are linked via a butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol (BT) linker. Since two chiral centers are present in the BT linker (C2 and C3), three BTM stereoisomers (A-BTM, B-BTM, and M-BTM) may be synthesized. The BT linker for A-isomers includes a chiral center having 2S and 3S configurations, and the BT linker for B-isomers includes 2S and 3S configurations. Therefore, since hydrophobic groups of the A-/B-BTMs have a mirror-image relationship with each other, the A-/B-BTMs are enantiomers of each other. On the other hand, the BT linker having 2R and 3S (or 2S and 3R) configurations is used to prepare M-isomers. Therefore, there is a diastereomeric relationship between hydrophobic groups of the M-isomers and the A-/B-isomers. The M-isomer is a meso compound because planes of symmetry are present in the hydrophobic group of the M-isomer. Since a hydrophobic group of each of the A-/B-/M-BTMs is linked to two dimaltoside hydrophilic groups via a stereospecific β-glycosidic bond, all the compounds have a diastereomeric relationship due to different relative directionality of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups.

9397,"Also, the respective compounds had carbon chain lengths varying from C9 to C11 in each of the compounds, which were used to name the compounds. The A- and B-isomers were prepared by introducing two hydroxyl groups into a and 3 faces of an (E)-but-2-ene-1,4-diol derivative. The high stereospecificity of this reaction was achieved through the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation well known in the art. On the other hand, the M-isomers were prepared from (Z)-but-2-ene-1,4-diol through Syn-dihydroxylation using OsO4. The M-BTMs have advantages in synthesis over other isomers (A-/B-BTMs) because the M-BTMs may be prepared through a 4-step high-yield synthesis process. On the other hand, a lot of effort and costs are required to mass-produce two different isomers (A-/B-isomers). This is because an expensive AD-Mix-α/β reagent is used in a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation process used in the step of introducing stereoselective chirality into the C2/C3 carbon, and a reaction time of 5 days was also required. In the synthesis protocol consisting of 4 steps required to prepare a final amphiphilic molecule, the entire yield was in a range of 50 to 60%.

9398,"The high diastereomeric purities of different isomers were confirmed through the 1H NMR spectra of the different isomers (FIGS. 4A to 4C and FIG. 5). Hydrogen of the A- and B-isomers of the BTM-C9 attached to an anomeric carbon (C1) was designated “Ha.” In this case, these respective hydrogen atoms were observed as doublets at 4.53 and 4.46 ppm on the 1H HMR spectrum. On the other hand, in the case of the M-isomers, the central regions of the doublets had two separate peaks at 4.48 and 4.54 ppm, respectively.

9399,"Also, considering that a coupling constant (3J) of all the isomers to the anomeric hydrogen (Ha) was 8.0 Hz, it was revealed that the β-glycosidic bond was successfully formed in the glycosylation step. Since the α-glycosidic bond had a smaller coupling constant (3J=4.0 Hz) with respect to the anomeric hydrogen, and peaks of the α-glycosidic bond was also positioned in the vicinity of 5.14 ppm, the anomeric hydrogen was clearly distinct from the anomeric hydrogen having the β-glycosidic bond. This was observed for hydrogen (He) attached to another anomeric carbon (C1′) in all the BTM isomers (FIG. 5).

9427,"The CMC values (0.023 to 0.006 mM) of all the BTMs were significantly lower than the CMC value (0.17 mM) of DDM. Therefore, it was revealed that the BTMs were able to have a similar or superior effect to DDM when used at a small amount since the micelles were easily formed when the BTMs were present at a low concentration. Also, the CMC values of the BTMs were reduced with an increase in the length of the alkyl chain from C9 to C11, which is determined to be due to increased hydrophobicity with an extension in the length of the alkyl chain. Among the three BTM stereoisomers, the M-isomers had the lowest CMC value, and the A-isomers had the second lowest CMC value. Since the three stereoisomers contain the same hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups (that is, the same hydrophile-lipophile balance), these results suggest that the stereoisomers have different tendencies in self-aggregation, depending on the stereochemistry thereof. The M-isomers had the highest tendency in self-aggregation, followed by the A-isomers and then the B-isomers.

9428,"The size of the micelles formed by the BTMs tended to increase with an increase in the length of the alkyl chain. There is a small difference in micelle size between the A-isomers and the B-isomers because there is an optically isomeric relationship between the hydrophobic groups. On the other hand, the M-isomers tended to form significantly larger micelles, compared to the other stereoisomers. This is because the M-isomers have a diastereomeric relationship with the hydrophobic groups of the other isomers.
",0,US20200123187A1.txt,0
9429,"It is judged that such distinct characteristics (a small CMC value and a large micelle size) of the M-isomers compared to those of the A- and B-isomers are based on changes in molecular structure of the other isomers in a water-soluble medium. In a gaseous state, each molecule assumes a staggered form between carbon substituents to form a dihedral angle of 60° between two alkyl chains and two dimaltoside hydrophilic groups (indicated by X and Y in FIG. 3, respectively). However, two alkyl chains of each isomer are subjected to a force which brings them closer to each other due to a hydrophobic effect in a water-soluble environment, resulting in a decreased dihedral angle (X) between the two alkyl chains. Such a decrease in the dihedral angle causes an increase in torsional/steric strain in molecules. Therefore, it is expected that two alkyl chains of an amphiphilic molecule dissolved in a water-soluble solution may adopt a compromise position between two opposing forces to form a dihedral angle (X) smaller than 60°. It is interesting to note that the decreased dihedral angle (X) causes different results in the relative orientation of the dimaltoside hydrophilic groups, depending on the stereochemistry of the isomers (A-/B-/M-isomers). Specifically, a decrease in the X dihedral angle causes a decrease in a dihedral angle (Y) between two hydrophilic groups in the M-isomers, but may rather cause an increase in the dihedral angle (Y) in the A-/B-isomers. As a result, the M-isomers adopt a structure having a relatively small dihedral angle in both X and Y, resulting in decreased volume of hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, compared to the other isomers. Such distinct characteristics of the M-isomers are expected to lead to more effective packing of micelles than the A- and B-isomers having a relatively large hydrophilic volume, and thus contribute positively to the stability of membrane proteins. Such structural characteristics have something to do with the relatively small CMC value and the formation of large micelles, as observed for the M-isomers. That is, the M-isomers form micelles having a large diameter since the M-isomers have a geometric structure closer to a cylindrical shape than those of the A- and B-isomers.

9430,"When the energy-minimized structure of each isomer was calculated at a level of B3LYP/6-31G using the density functional theory (DFT), the Y dihedral angle was lowest in the M-isomers (FIG. 6). In this calculation, the M-isomers had both X and Y dihedral angles smaller than 60°, and the A- and B-isomers had an X dihedral angle smaller than 60° and a Y dihedral angle larger than 60°. Such results of calculation support our hypothesis about relative movement of the alkyl chains and hydrophilic groups due to a hydrophobic effect in a water-soluble solution.

9448,"Also, the ligand-binding characteristics of the receptor dissolved in A-BTM-C11, M-BTM-C11 or DDM were monitored at regular intervals while the receptor was incubated at room temperature for 3 days. The results are shown in FIG. 12C. As a result, it was revealed that the receptor solubilized with DDM initially had a high ability to bind to a ligand, but the binding characteristics of the receptor were drastically lost, and eventually only 10% of the initial binding ability remained after 3 days of incubation. On the other hand, the receptor solubilized with M-BTM-C11 had initial ligand-binding characteristics similar to those of the receptor solubilized with DDM, but the ligand-binding characteristics of the receptor were maintained at approximately 70% of an initial ligand-binding ability after 3 days of incubation (FIG. 12C). M-BTM-C11 had a very high effect in stabilizing the receptor even with the absence of CHS, compared to DDM. Also, it judged that an effect of the amphiphilic compounds on the stability of the receptor (β2AR) is determined in the order of M-BTMs>A-BTMs>B-BTMs.

9449,"Therefore, it can be seen that, among the BTMs, M-BTM-C11 especially had a much more superior effect in maintaining the long-term stability of β2AR, compared to DDM.

9451,"The BTM-C11s exhibiting excellent effects in the experiments on UapA, LeuT and β2AR were selected to perform an experiment for determining the structural stability of a Salmonella typhimurium melibiose permease (MelB) protein by BTM-C11s. The MelB protein was extracted from a membrane using BTM-C11s or DDM, and the amount and structure of the extracted protein were analyzed through SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting. A concentration of the amphiphilic compound used was 1.5% by weight, and the protein was extracted at four temperatures (0, 45, 55, and 65° C.), and incubated at the same temperature for 90 minutes. Thereafter, an amount of the protein remaining dissolved in an aqueous solution was measured to evaluate two types of performance: protein extraction efficiency and stabilization ability of the compound. The amount of the protein extracted and stabilized with each of the amphiphilic molecules is expressed as a relative value (%) of the entire amount of proteins contained in a membrane sample which is not treated with the amphiphilic molecules.
",0,US20200123187A1.txt,0
9452,"Specifically, Salmonella typhimurium melibiose permease (MelBSt) having a 10-His tag at the C-terminus thereof was expressed in E. coli DW2 cells (AmelB and AlacZY) using a plasmid pK95ΔAHB/WT MelBSt/CH10. Cell growth and membrane preparation were performed according to the method disclosed in the article by A. S. Ethayathulla et al. (Nat. Commun. 2014, 5, 3009). A protein assay was performed using a Micro BCA kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). An effect of the isomers (A-BTM-C11, B-BTM-C11, and M-BTM-C11) of the BTM-C11s or DDM on the MelBSt stability was evaluated using the protocol disclosed in P. S. Chae et al. (Nat. Methods 2010, 7, 1003-1008). A membrane sample (having a final protein concentration of 10 mg/mL) containing MelBSt was incubated at four temperatures (0, 45, 55, and 65° C.) for 90 minutes in a solubilizing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mM melibiose) containing 1.5% (w/v) DDM or the BTM-C11 isomers. To remove insoluble matter, the sample was ultracentrifuged at 355,590 g at 4° C. for 45 minutes using a Beckman Optima™ MAX ultracentrifuge equipped with a TLA-100 rotor. The dissolved fraction was separated by 16% SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with a Penta-His-HRP antibody (Qiagen, Germantown, Md.). The membrane fraction containing 20 μg of untreated proteins was used to represent the entire MelB, and the treated samples were loaded in each well at the same volume. MelBSt was measured by an ImageQuant LAS 4000 Biomolecular imager (GE Health Care Life Sciences) using a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate.

9453,"From the results as shown in FIG. 13, it was revealed that DDM had high MelB protein extraction efficiency at 0° C.

9454,"However, when the temperature increased to 45° C., all the BTM isomers had an effect of effectively extracting the MelB protein, and had a level of MelB solubility similar to DDM. Among the steric isomers, the M-isomers had the best effect at this temperature.

9455,"When the temperature increased to 55° C., a greater difference between the M-isomers and the A-/B-isomers was observed. It can be seen that MelB solubilized with M-BTM-C11 exhibited complete solubility even at this high temperature, but an amount of the protein solubilized with the A- or B-isomers drastically decreased. Since the extraction efficiency of DDM was further reduced at this temperature, an amount of the protein remaining dissolved in an aqueous solution accounted for only approximately 15% of the extracted protein.

9456,"The superiority of the M-isomers to DDM and two other isomers was determined by solubilizing MelB at 65° C.

9467,"A color filter is used in liquid crystal display devices and light-emitting display devices. For example, in the case of color LCDs, the amount of light is controlled by using a backlight as the light source and electrically driving the liquid crystal. The light passes through the color filter and represents colors. In light-emitting display devices, a color image is formed in the same manner as liquid crystal display devices, when the color filter is used in combination with a white light emitting element.

9468,"A recent trend is that there is a demand for power-saving image display devices. To increase backlight use efficiency, there is a very high demand for high-luminance color filters. This is a major issue especially for mobile displays (such as mobile phones, smart phones and tablet PCs).

9527,"In the general formula (I), “A” is a linking group linking two or more color-forming moieties. It was estimated that the heat resistance of the compound is increased when the linking group “A” contains a tough cyclic skeleton. However, it is estimated that the color-forming moieties linked by the cyclic skeleton are more rigid than the case of being linked by a chain skeleton, resulting in a decrease in the freedom of rotational motion. It was estimated that since the triarylmethane or xanthene moiety, which is a color moiety, contains a bulky structure, if its rotational motion is suppressed, free molecular motion is inhibited at the time of heating, which causes distortion and, as a result, becomes a cause for molecular decomposition. In the compound of the present disclosure, when “A” is the above-specified aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing two or more alicyclic hydrocarbon groups, rotational motion is ensured at the linking moiety linking at least two or more alicyclic hydrocarbon groups. Therefore, the two or more color-forming moieties are allowed to move independently to some degree, so that distortion is less likely to occur and, as a result, the heat resistance of the compound is increased.

9528,"R2 to R5 are substituent groups bound to nitrogen atoms constituting the color-forming moieties.

It is also estimated that since at least one of R2 to R5 is an electron-donating cycloalkyl group, electron density in the resonance structure of the color-forming moieties is increased, thereby increasing the stability of the color-forming moieties.

9530,"In the color material represented by the general formula (I), triarylmethane or xanthene skeletons have such a structure that two or more of them are connected through the linking group “A”, thereby forming a polyvalent cation. In the compound represented by the general formula (I), a divalent or higher anion is used as a counter anion. Therefore, it is estimated that as shown by the example in FIG. 4, in the compound represented by the general formula (I), a molecular association 210 in which molecules are continuously connected through ionic bonds and associated, is formed by using a divalent or higher cation 201 in combination with a divalent or higher anion 202. Since the molecular association acts as one molecule in an aggregate of the color material, it is estimated that the apparent molecular weight of the molecular association is much larger than that of a conventional salt-forming compound in which anions and cations bind to each other on a one-on-one basis, and the molecular association contributes to an increase in the heat resistance of the compound. Since the molecular association is composed of cations and anions, it is thought that the ionic bonds are strengthened by increasing cationicity (basicity), whereby the molecular association is synergistically stabilized. Also, since the two or more color-forming moieties in the molecular association are allowed to move independently to some degree, distortion is less likely to occur. Accordingly, it is thought that the ionic bond can keep a distance, and the molecular association is synergistically stabilized, therefore. From these reasons, it is estimated that a coating film formed by use of the color material dispersion liquid of the disclosed embodiments, is excellent in heat resistance.

",0,US20200164075A1.txt,0
10038,"In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of both diagnostics and therapeutics that take advantage of the expression and activity of PSMA/GCPII. Prostate cancer (PCa) and breast cancer ranks first in terms of cancer-related deaths among men and women in the United States whereas it is lung followed by breast in Indian population in 2017 with prostate ranking third among all cancers in Indian men accounting for 7% of all cases. As per the American Cancer Society report in 2017, about 1,688,780 new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed with cancer becoming the leading cause of mortality surpassing cardiovascular disease worldwide. It is estimated that 22 million people would be diagnosed for cancer by 2030 resulting in 13 million deaths every year.
",0,US20200164075A1.txt,0
10039,"PSMA or GCPII's exact function in cancer is unknown. However, many studies have linked its role to tumour progression and carcinogenesis. In the brain, PSMA or GCPII metabolizes the neurotransmitter NAAG and it has now been identified as a target for therapeutic interventions and diagnostics in various neurological disorders and also in cancers of prostate, breast, bladder, brain etc.
",0,US20200164075A1.txt,0
10040,"Early diagnosis of prostate cancer is most commonly achieved by blood test for prostate specific antigen (PSA), or a prostate biopsy. Later stages of prostate cancer can be detected by performing a biopsy which is extremely painful and expensive. The PSA diagnostic test has been widely criticized due to its inaccuracy in diseases like benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and prostatitis. Axumin is a recently approved radioactive diagnostic agent by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prostate carcinoma. It is generally used during positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in men based on elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels who are suspected with recurring cases of prostate cancer after undergoing treatment. Another FDA approved diagnostic agent for prostate cancer, marketed as ProstaScint, is an 111In-labeled anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody [111In]7E11-C5 imaging agent for detection of metastasis in patients with prostate cancer. However, long circulating half-life of monoclonal antibodies in plasma along with their low permeability in tumors limit the success of these antibodies in diagnosis of this kind of cancer. It has been discovered that biologically active compounds that are conjugated to inhibitors or ligands capable of binding to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) via a linker may be useful for radio as well as optical imaging in diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Few small molecule inhibitors for PSMA are well documented in the literature with nanomolar binding affinity; 2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA), (S)-2-(3-((S)-5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)ureido) pentanedioic acid, which are now in various stages of clinical trials. This area therefore requires further research and development.
",0,US20200164075A1.txt,0
10041,"In existing diagnostic methods like digital rectal examination (DRE), blood test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) and biopsy are inconclusive, can give false positive results, and are highly inaccurate and insensitive for detection of prostate cancer. Although prostate enlargement and growth asymmetry can be examined by transrectal ultrasound jointly with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) these diagnostic tests are costly and difficult to afford on routine basis. The primary cause of PCa is the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and subsequent metastasis followed by chemoresistance for which there is no known cure. Early stage prostate tumors can be treated by surgery, radiation, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). However, recurrence takes place within 2-3 years and the mean survival time for CRPC is only 16-18 months.
",0,US20200164075A1.txt,0
10042,"During the last few decades there have been observed increase in the development of a variety of imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. These techniques have greatly improved and facilitated the detection of cancers. However, the most important factor which facilitates the survival of patients suffering from cancer is the complete surgical resection of the tumor. The complete surgical removal of the tumor prevents chances of tumor recurrence and the most important aspect required for this is the differentiation between tumor and normal tissue during surgery. Visual inspection and evaluation of the tumor margins are now typically assessed intraoperatively. However, it is the possibility of a microinvasion of the cancer to surrounding tissues which increases the difficulty in determining an excision margin that is completely tumor free. This difficulty finally forces surgeons to perform wide excisions during surgery which lead to the damage of healthy tissues resulting in loss of functional structures. Once surgeons are able to visually evaluate the minimum safety margins during tumor excision clearly, it will be possible to completely remove the tumor. Therefore, there is a critical, unmet need for accurate cost effective diagnostic tool that can detect and treat early stages of prostate cancer or other related neuro degenerative diseases involving PSMA protein. In future, NIR fluorescent small molecule conjugates would be used as an intra-operative diagnostic tool for detection and surgical of PSMA expressing malignant masses during cancer surgery.

10043,"Moreover, in western countries few small molecule PSMA radiopharmaceuticals have reached human clinical trials in addition to three approved diagnostic agents (ProstaScint, Choline C11 and Axumin) by FDA for detection of PCa. The cost of FDA approved PCa diagnostics in the USA range from USD 9500 to 3700 per scan. Lack of sustained efforts to prepare PCa diagnostics have hampered affordable healthcare in India.

10044,"Therefore, developing new and indigenous radiopharmaceuticals that can be protected across the world for PCa. In this context, very little research progress has been achieved in India. In spite of this setback, for the past several years there have been some advances in prostate cancer diagnosis and radio therapy using reported and patented PSMA agents such as 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (PSMA-11) and 177Lu-PSMA-617 in clinical scenario for Indian patients. This will restrict us to play a significant role in the global arena for improving the quality of life of ailing patients from prostate malignancy.

10045,"Earlier, in 1996, FDA had approved the first diagnostic agent called ProstaScint (111In-labeled anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody) for detection of soft tissue metastases in patients with prostate cancer. However, there has been limited clinical success using this monoclonal antibody agent, because of its long circulating plasma half-life, low permeability in solid tumors, particularly for detection of metastatic disease to bone, high production cost (USD 9500), low shelf life, longer scanning sessions (four to five days) and possible immunoreaction. In 2012, FDA approved Choline 11C for PET imaging, but Choline 11C's short half-life limits its use to medical centers with on-site production capability. In the mid-2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Axumin (USD 3700 per scan), a PET diagnostic agent derived from synthetic fluorocyclobutane amino acid, for detection of prostate carcinoma, the uptake of which is based on over-expression of amino acid transporters in PCa. This imaging agent is generally employed to detect suspected recurrent prostate cancer based on elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels following treatment of initial disease.

The effect of substituents and structural activity relationship of the newly designed molecules with the binding cavity of the PSMA protein of interest has been thoroughly studied by modeling studies. After the rational design of the molecules or inhibitors or ligands, using computational methods a new, mild and simple chemical synthetic strategy is developed to synthesize a small library of new PSMA inhibitors. All the inhibitors or ligands or molecules were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques for structural confirmation. Finally, inhibitors which had shown the most promising theoretical binding affinity to PSMA protein labeled as AAPT were carried forward for in vitro and in vivo biological evaluations. The high binding affinity inhibitor AAPT is also conjugated with fluorescent tag such as rhodamine B through a peptidic spacer and the resultant fluorescent conjugate was evaluated for its uptake in malignant cell lines expressing the targeted protein PSMA of interest. The binding affinity constant KD of the fluorescent peptide conjugate to PSMA protein is determined to be in nano-molar concentration. In vitro evaluation studies have confirmed the selectivity and specificity of the molecules to bind to cancer cell lines over-expressing PSMA protein. The work now awaits in vivo evaluation in small animals such as mice, rat or guinea pigs which will be carried out in near future by tagging the inhibitors via chelating linkers to radioisotopes such as 99mTc, 68Ga, 18F for diagnostic and therapeutic (17Lu) applications.

During the re-docking study of JB7 with the protein, similar amino acids interactions were observed as reported for JB7 with native protein (PDB 4NGM). In addition, an extra hydrogen bonding interaction with Lys 699 and Arg 536 residues were also observed. Moreover, in Surflex dock module of SYBYL, hydrogen bond distance more than 3 Å length are considered as weak and are not visible during docking study. As a result, hydrogen bonding interaction of JB7 with aminoacid residue Glu 424 of the protein was not observed which is of the order of 3.1 Å in length. After successful validation of docking procedure of JB7 with GCPII, similar protocol was applied for studying the docking interactions of newly designed amino-acetamide derivatives 1-10 with GCPII.

10177,"In an embodiment in FIG. 4, among all the newly designed amino-acetamide ligands, the docking score of ligand 1 is found to be highest followed by ligands 3 (second most active) and 2 (third most active) in the series (Table 1). The docking conformation of the most active ligand, 1, in the series show nine hydrogen bonding interactions at hydrophilic S1′ pocket with Tyr 700, Arg 210, Lys 699, Asn 257, Tyr 552, Glu 424 and Glu 425 (new hydrogen bonding interactions) residues. This fact suggested that the glutamate moiety of 1 interacts strongly with the protein active site compared to JB7. However, ligand 1 exhibits similar hydrogen bonding interaction as JB7 with hydrophobic S1 pocket (FIG. 5). Insertion of an extra methylene group after the amide bond leads to an increase in the number of hydrogen bond interactions with aminoacid residues such as Arg 210, Asn 257, Glu 424, Asn 519 and Arg 534. The carbonyl oxygen of amino acetamide ligand in 1 also interacts with the hydroxy group of Tyr 552 in S1′ pocket of PSMA with a bond length of 1.72 Å which is considerably less than the bonding interaction (2.65 Å) of urea carbonyl oxygen moiety of JB7 with OH group of Tyr 552. It is important to note that Tyr 552 is positioned near Zn atoms of GCPII protein, which is important for catalytic activity of PSMA.

10179,"In an embodiment in FIG. 5, Strong interaction of 1 with Tyr 552 residue at the active site of the protein might be helpful in inhibiting the catalytic activity of GCPII. This strong hydrogen bonding interaction of 1 with GCPII could be responsible for higher binding affinity of 1 among other ligands in the series. Though ligand 1 forms more number of hydrogen bonds due to the presence of polar glutamate scaffold, the overall docking score of JB7 was found to be higher as compared to 1. This is because the efficacy of inhibitory activity of ligands not only depends on polar interactions but also on other non-polar interactions such as lipophilic and π-π stacking interactions due to the presence of benzyl group in the lysine moiety of JB7. Further, to analyze the effect of polar and non-polar substituents on the efficiency of ligands to inhibit activity of GCPII enzyme, several derivatives of amino acetamide ligands such as 2-10 have been designed and synthesized for evaluation. After glutamate ligand 1, phenylalanine (3) and tyrosine (2) derivatives were observed to have better docking score than the other designed analogs. The docking conformation of the second most active ligand (3) in series show ten hydrogen bonding interaction with the active site residues such as Arg 210, Asn 257, Lys 699, Tyr 552 and Glu 424 at the hydrophilic pocket of the enzyme. Slightly less activity of 3 as compared to 1 is due to less number of hydrogen bonding interactions (Table 2) of 3 at the hydrophobic pocket of GCPII enzyme.

10181,"In an embodiment in FIG. 6, because of the presence of hydroxyl group of tyrosine moiety in 2, there is a change in the orientation of tyrosine moiety leading to change in the total number of amino acid interactions of 2 as compared to 3 with GCPII. At 51′ site (hydrophilic pocket), 3 forms seven hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg 210, Asn 257, Lys 699 and Glu 425 aminoacid residues, whereas 2 forms only two hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg 210 and Lys 699 and no interaction with Asn 257 and Glu 425 residues when compared to 3. However, 2 forms an additional H-bonding interaction with Tyr 552 along with a new interaction with Tyr 700 in the active site of GCPII in comparison to 3. Including two interactions of both 2 and 3 with Glu 424 residue, the total number interactions of 2 and 3 at hydrophilic pocket are seven and ten respectively.

10183,"In an embodiment in FIG. 7, at S1 site (hydrophobic pocket), 3 forms four hydrogen bonding interactions with Gly 518, Asn 519 and Arg 534 which were absent in 2. Due to change in the orientation of 2, it forms six new interactions with Asp 453, Asp 387, Ser 454, Tyr 549 and Ser 517 aminoacid residues that were absent in 3. This study infers that at GCPII active site, 3 forms fourteen hydrogen bonding interactions while 2 forms only thirteen interactions. This may be the plausible reason for less docking score of ligand 2 as compared to 3. In summary, we have designed and developed amino acetamide derivatives as a new class of GCPII inhibitor through extensive molecular docking studies. Ten amino acetamide based ligands/inhibitors (1-10) have been rationally designed and through molecular docking study top three rank derivatives (1-3) were selected for detailed analysis of amino acid-ligand interactions. However, derivatives 4-10 were also studied for various interactions at the active site of GCPII without detailed interpretation of the theoretical data presented in table 2.

The results of this study are presented in FIG. 11a-11c .

The amount of glutamic acid released by the hydrolysis of NAAG during competitive inhibition by AAPT inhibitor was measured by incubating each well with a working solution of Amplex Red reagent (100 uM, 50 μL) for 30 min at 37° C. The fluorescence emission from each well, proportional to the amount of released glutamic acid, was measured using Synergy H1 multimode plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, Vt., USA) at an excitation and emission wavelength of 530 nm and 590 nm respectively.

The resin was washed with DMF (3.0 mL×3) followed by isopropanol (3.0 mL×3). The completion of reaction was confirmed by performing the Kaiser test. A solution of 20% piperidine in DMF (4 mL) was added to the peptide vessel and the resin beads were bubbled for 10 minutes. The procedure was repeated twice (3 mL×2) to ensure complete deprotection of Fmoc protecting group from the coupled amino acid. The resin beads were washed with DMF (3.0 mL×3) and isopropanol (3.0 mL×3) and the formation of free amine was confirmed by performing the Kaiser test. Consecutively, Fmoc-Lys(Tfa)-OH, Fmoc-8-aminocaprylic acid, Fmoc-Phe-OH, Fmoc-Phe-OH and Fmoc-8-aminocaprylic acid were attached to the growing peptide chain in sequence as mentioned before.

The selective uptake of the newly synthesized PSMA targeted near-infra red fluorescent conjugate, AAPT-C17201, was evaluated by studying the ability of AAPT inhibitor or ligand to deliver diagnostics or fluorescent cargos to PSMA protein expressing cancer cell lines such as LNCaP cells. The fluorescent conjugate, AAPT-C17201, was synthesized by tethering a high affinity AAPT inhibitor via a peptidic spacer to Rhodamine B using standard solid phase peptide synthesis methodology. The purified PSMA targeted ligand conjugate, AAPT-C17201, was evaluated in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) expressing PSMA protein using laser scanning confocal microscopy for wide range of low nanomolar concentrations-5, 10, 25 nM.

The binding affinity constant of PSMA targeted fluorescent conjugate, AAPT-C17201, to target PSMA was determined in vitro in LNCaP cells by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity per cell for different concentrations of the fluorescent conjugate in triplicate using Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) study. A hyperbolic curve of different concentrations of fluorescent conjugates 22 or 25 against the mean fluorescence intensity in the PSMA+ LNCaP cells yields a dissociation constant (KD) of 85 nM or 130 nM, respectively. The high dissociation constant value (˜85 nM) gives us undisputable evidence for the high affinity of AAPT-C17201 fluorescent conjugate to PSMA protein and its perfect fit to the 20 Å protein tunnel present in PSMA.

After optimizing docking studies with PSMA protein, we have discovered a novel, simple, mild and high yielding synthetic strategy for the preparation of 4 via retrosynthetic analysis. The newly synthesized inhibitors 4 were screened for PSMA enzyme inhibition by in vitro experiments using PSMA enzyme isolate from human prostate cancer lines.

The reaction mixture was refluxed at 80° C. for 18-20 h. The reaction progress was monitored through TLC. After the completion of the reaction, THF was evaporated under reduced pressure and 30 mL of ethyl acetate was added to the crude reaction mixture. The organic layer was washed with distilled water (2×15 mL) and the resultant organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude products 15a-j were purified through column chromatography using distilled 33% ethyl acetate and hexane mixture as eluent.

Meanwhile, membrane portion of PSMA enzyme was extracted from PSMA+ LNCaP cell line by following a reported protocol. Briefly LNCaP cells (1 million) were harvested in HEPES buffer (1 mL) and lyzed twice using probe sonicator for 30 s. The lysate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000×g for 30 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was homogenized by addition of HEPES buffer (1 mL) and used for PSMA enzyme inhibition assay. The isolated enzyme (100 μL, 8.3027 ng) was incubated with different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 100, 200, 300, 500 and 1000 nM) of the inhibitor 1-3 (100 μL) in the presence of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) (50 μL, 30 nM) for 60 min. The amount of glutamic acid released by the hydrolysis of NAAG was measured by incubating a working solution of Amplex Red reagent (50 μL, 100 μM) for 30 min at 37° C. The fluorescence emission after the oxidation of Amplex Red reagent was measured by using Synergy H1 multimode plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, Vt., USA). The excitation wavelength was fixed at 530 nm, and the fluorescence emission is measured at 590 nm. Dose v/s response inhibition curve was obtained using semi-log plot of concentration of inhibitors 1-3 versus fluorescence intensity emission to provide experimental IC50 values and compared with a known standard GCPII inhibitor, PMPA by following a similar procedure.

11148,"Conventionally, a glass material has been used for an optical member of an imaging module such as a camera, a video camera, a mobile phone with a camera, a video phone, or a door phone with a camera. Glass materials have been used preferably because they have various optical characteristics and excellent environmental resistance, but they have a disadvantage in that weight reduction and miniaturization are not easy and workability or productivity is poor. In contrast, since a resin cured product can be produced in a massive amount and has excellent workability, the resin cured product has recently been used in various optical members.
",0,US20200181061A1.txt,0
11149,"In recent years, in accordance with miniaturization of an imaging module, a size of an optical member used in the imaging module is required to be reduced, but in a case of miniaturizing an optical member, a problem of chromatic aberration occurs. It is possible to correct chromatic aberration by allowing a resin cured product forming an optical member to have a small Abbe number.

11151,"JP2015-199952A discloses that by using a (meth)acrylate compound having a bis(aryl)fluorene skeleton, it is possible to obtain a curable composition which has excellent handleability characteristics without using a diluent, and which enables a high refractive index to be compatible with scratch resistance in a cured product. WO2017/115649A discloses that by using a compound having a heteroaryl group in a bis(aryl)fluorene-like skeleton, it is possible to obtain a curable composition that enables formation of a cured product having a small Abbe number. JP2014-080572A discloses that by using a compound having a fused aromatic ring group in a bis(aryl)fluorene-like skeleton and a non-conjugated-vinylidene-group-containing compound, it is possible to obtain a curable composition that enables formation of a cured product having a small Abbe number.

",0,US20200181061A1.txt,0
11153,"In the case of the compound disclosed in JP2015-199952A, a cured product has a high saturated water absorption of 1.55%, and therefore there is still room for improvement in moisture-heat resistance. In addition, in a case where a composition containing a high concentration of a compound having a bis(aryl)fluorene skeleton or a skeleton similar thereto is used in manufacture of an optical member using the compounds disclosed in JP2015-199952A, WO2017/115649A, and JP2014-080572A, a cured product having a smaller Abbe number is easily obtained. However, a curable composition containing a high concentration of a monomer having the above-mentioned skeleton easily becomes highly viscous or is easily crystallized, and this may affect handleability during molding and quality of a cured product to be obtained. Furthermore, the above-mentioned curable composition easily changes its moldability after long-term storage, particularly at low temperatures or the like.

In particular, an object of the present invention is to provide a compound which has a bis(aryl)fluorene-like skeleton and is unlikely to be crystallized in a case where it is prepared as a curable composition.

For example, a protective film, an antireflection film, a hard coating film, or the like may be formed on the surface of the lens substrate. Further, it can be a compound lens in which a glass lens substrate or a plastic lens substrate is laminated. It is also possible to make the periphery of the lens substrate intrude and be fixed in a substrate holding frame or the like. However, those films and frames or the like are additional members to the lens substrate and therefore differ from the lens substrate itself referred to in the present specification.

",0,US20200308177A1.txt,0
11879,"Protein kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation of specific residues of other proteins, and plays an important role in signal-transduction pathways that transduce extracellular signals to the nucleus. Further, it is involved in various diseases in vivo. In the onset or development of inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease, proliferative disease or hyperproliferative disease, and/or immunity mediated disease, there is various evidence that T-cells (or T-lymphocytes) and B-cells (or B-lymphocytes) play an important role.
",0,US20200308177A1.txt,0
11880,"Janus kinase (hereinafter referred to as “JAK”) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that plays pivotal roles in regulating cell function in the lympho-hematopoietic system. Cytokines are known to play an important role in regulating inflammation, immunity and normal cell function, and JAK activates STAT (Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription) proteins through tyrosine phosphorylation to provide rapid signaling pathways to cytokines. JAK/STAT signaling is known to be associated with allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases (e.g., transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis etc.), solid cancers, blood cancers (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma and so on).
",0,US20200308177A1.txt,0
11881,"The JAK family is classified into four members: JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3, and TYK 2. Members of the JAK family pair with each other to mediate signals from a variety of cytokines. It includes JAK2 and JAK1 associated with hematopoietic growth factor signaling, and a combination of TYK2 and JAK2 is important for interferon signaling and contributes to host tolerance. JAK2 can induce anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, especially when it is involved in the hematopoietic growth factor signaling and causes excessive inhibition.
",0,US20200308177A1.txt,0
11882,"The expression of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 was found to be widely distributed, whereas the expression of JAK3 was restricted to lymphocytes and is associated with signaling for the common gamma chains, members of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors, particularly the common gamma chain of the IL-2 family. As soon as the cytokine is bound, the receptor carries adjacent JAK3 nearby, which induces autophosphorylation of the β-chain C-terminus. As a result, it causes activation of the STAT protein, which is an important step in retransmitting the signal to the nucleus. JAK3 controls the signal pathways of various cytokines through this process. This makes JAK3 as an attractive target for immunosuppression.

11883,"B cells play an important role in the development of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. Protein-based therapeutic agents that reduce B cells, for example Rituxan, are effective in autoantibody-induced inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, protein kinase inhibitors that play a role in B cell activation are useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of B cell-mediated diseases, for example, for the production of autoantibodies.
",0,US20200308177A1.txt,0
11884,"Signal transduction through B cell receptor (BCR) regulates various B cell responses, including proliferation and differentiation into mature antibody-producing cells. BCR is an important regulatory element of B cell activity, and abnormal signal transduction can cause the formation of pathogenic autoantibodies leading to a plurality of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases and the proliferation of deregulated B cell.

11885,"Bruton tyrosine kinase (hereinafter, referred to as “BTK”) is an important regulator of the development, activation, signaling and survival of B-cells. BTK is involved in signal transduction pathways initiated by binding various extracellular ligands to their cell surface receptors. Following ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), the activity of BTK by the coincident action of the protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk is required for the induction of the phospholipase C-v2-mediated calcium mobilization. Therefore, inhibition of BTK can be a useful therapeutic approach in blocking the onset process of B-cell mediated diseases.

Therefore, the development of substances that effectively inhibit these diseases can be useful as a related therapeutic agent. Specific examples of the diseases which can be treated and prevented include cancer, transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, asthma, allergic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, type I diabetes, diabetic complication, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, autoimmune thyroid disorder, systemic depilation, Sjogren syndrome and the like.

12133,"Specifically, the inhibitory activities against JAK3 and BTK kinase were measured using a JAK3 kinase assay kit (Promega, V9441) and a BTK kinase assay kit (Promega, V9071) which were purchased from Promega. Recombinant purified human JAK3 and BTK were diluted with 1×kinase reaction buffer (JAK3: 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 50 uM DTT/BTK: 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 2 mM MnCl2 and 50 uM DTT) and added to 96 well plates (JAK3: final concentration of 4 ng per reaction/BTK: final concentration of 8 ng per reaction). The compounds prepared in the previous Examples were treated so as to be finally a 1% DMSO aqueous solution, and a substrate cocktail containing ATP (JAK3: final concentration of 5 uM/BTK: final concentration of 10 uM) and 0.2 ug/uL of Poly(Glu4, Tyr1)peptide (JAK3 and BTK final concentration) in the total 25 uL reactants was added to 96-well plates to initiate enzymatic reaction. After incubation (30° C.) for 1 hour, equivalent volume (25 uL per reaction) of ADP Glo was added and incubated (30° C.) for 40 minutes at room temperature. Then, a kinase detection reagent (50 uL per reaction) was added and incubated (30° C.) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The kinase activity was measured by chemiluminescence according to the instructions of ADP Glow kinase assay kit, and the inhibitory activity of the compounds according to the present disclosure was calculated. For the analysis of the results of each compound, Microsoft Excel was used, and ICsa values were calculated by SiamaPlot software. The results are shown in Table 1 below. Further, for comparison, Tofacitinib and lbrutinib were evaluated in a similar way.

12225,"For a catalyst for a catalytic asymmetric synthesis reaction using a transition metal complex, one having better catalytic activity is required.
",0,US20200377536A1.txt,0
12226,"For example, for a hydroboration reaction, generally, the reaction proceeds with anti-Markovnikov type regioselectivity. On the other hand, a hydroboration reaction showing Markovnikov type selectivity is limited to styrene type substrates, and there are few examples of reports on such hydroboration reactions of terminal alkenes substituted by alkyl groups. In addition, even if the 2,3-bis(dialkylphosphino)pyrazine derivative represented by the chemical formula (A) is used as a ligand, the substrate application range, selectivity, and yield are insufficient.

The flask was immersed in a low temperature bath at −20° C., and while the Y liquid was stirred by a magnetic stirrer, a 1.0 M THF solution of potassium tert-butoxide (Z liquid) (3.6 mL, 3.6 mmol) was dropped into the Y liquid over 20 min. After the dropping, the mixture was maintained at the same temperature for 30 min, and then the temperature was increased to room temperature over about 1 h, and further stirring was continued for 4 h. The flask was immersed in an ice water bath, ethyl acetate (10 mL), water (7 mL), and 2 M hydrochloric acid (6.5 mL) were sequentially added, and the mixture was stirred well. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, and the upper layer was separated. The lower layer was subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate, and the organic layers were combined, washed with a saturated saline solution, and then dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off by an evaporator followed by vacuum drying to obtain an amorphous solid (1.22 g, 98%). Methanol (7 mL) was added to this product, and the mixture was stirred well by a spatula for crystallization. The obtained solid was filtered using a glass filter, and washed with methanol. The solid after the washing was vacuum-dried to obtain a yellow powder (990 mg, 78%). Then, 950 mg of this yellow powder was dissolved in 1.9 mL of THF at room temperature, 3.8 mL of methanol was added, and the mixture was cooled with ice water. After 2 h, the crystals were filtered, washed with an ice-cooled THF/MeOH (volume ratio 1:2) mixed solvent, and vacuum-dried to obtain a pure product of 720 mg of (R)-2-tert-butylmethylphosphino-3-diphenylphosphinoquinoxaline (1 g) as orange crystals (recrystallization recovery rate: 76%).

12585,"The N-heterocyclic compounds have been highlighted as important scaffolds, as they have found applications in synthetic biology, pharmaceuticals, and material science. In particular, pyrrole constitutes one of the most important N-heterocyclic motifs and ubiquitous in natural products, drug intermediates, agrochemicals, dyes, and functional materials. Given their importance, the development of efficient strategies for the synthesis of pyrroles from simple feedstock chemicals is a prime focus in contemporary science. The classical approach to pyrrole synthesis involves the well-established Knorr, Paal-Knorr, and Hantzsch methods. Recently, metal-catalyzed inter- and intramolecular cyclization reactions have provided alternative approaches to access them. However, the direct and sustainable access to pyrroles under atom-economical, eco-benign conditions from simple alcohols is appealing, since alcohols can be derived from abundantly available lignocellulosic biomass by hydrogenolysis.
",0,US20200384451A1.txt,0
12586,"Transition-metal-catalyzed acceptor less dehydrogenation (AD) and hydrogen auto transfer (HA) reactions have been attracting much interest in recent times, in large part due to the excellent step-economy and high atom-efficiency. These strategies play a crucial role in activating the inert chemical bonds, such as the O—H bond of alcohols and the N—H bond of amines without pre-functionalization. In particular, catalytic acceptor less dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reactions provide green synthetic methods for efficient organic transformations through tandem C—X (X═C, N, and O) bond-forming reactions with the liberation of H2 and H2O. Thus, ADC enables a direct and concise approach for the construction of diverse heterocyclic com-pounds from the easily available starting materials such as alcohols, amines, and unsaturated system. In 2013, Michlik and co-workers demonstrated the first direct synthesis of pyrroles from amino alcohols and secondary alcohols efficiently catalyzed by iridium (III)-complexes (Nature Chemistry; 2013, volume 5, pp 140-144).
