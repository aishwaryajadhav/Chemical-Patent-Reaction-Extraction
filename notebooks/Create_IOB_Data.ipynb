       "      <td>Glass fibre nonwovens/fabrics used: The following glass fibre nonwovens/fabrics were used in the examples, glass filament fabric 296 g/m 2 —Atlas, Finish FK 144 (Interglas 92626) Reactive Polyurethane Composition Reactive polyurethane compositions with the following formulae were used for the production of the prepregs and the composites.     The starting materials in the table are intimately mixed in a premixer and then dissolved in the stated solvent. To produce the prepreg, the glass fibre fabric is saturated with the solution of the matrix materials. The prepregs are dried to constant weight in an oven at temperatures of from 50 to 70° C., optionally with application of vacuum. The matrix volume content is determined as 34.2% in Example 1 (10 tests) and 33.9% in Example 2 (6 tests). The fibre volume contents are corresponding 65.8% (Example 1) and 66.1% (Example 2). DSC Measurements The DSC tests (glass transition temperature determinations and enthalpy of reaction measurements) are performed with a Mettler Toledo DSC 821e as per DIN 53765. The DSC studies of the prepregs from Examples 1 and 2 gives the following results:     The glass transition temperatures measured during the second heating procedure are the glass transition temperatures of the fully reacted/crosslinked matrix material. Storage Stability of the Prepregs The DSC studies of the prepregs from Examples 1 and 2 give the following results measured after 18 and, respectively, 40 days, seen in  FIGS. 1 and 2 . The reaction enthalpies measured do not decrease significantly during the course of storage, and this provides evidence of the reactivity of the matrix material. Composite Component Production The composite components are produced on a composite press by a compression technique known to those skilled in the art. The homogeneous prepregs produced by direct impregnation were compressed into composite materials on a benchtop press. This benchtop press is the Polystat 200 T from the firm Schwabenthan, with which the prepregs are compressed to the corresponding composite sheets at temperatures between 120 and 200° C. The pressure is varied between normal pressure and 450 bar. Dynamic compression, i.e. alternating applications of pressure, can prove advantageous for the crosslinking of the fibres depending on the component size, component thickness and polyurethane composition and hence the viscosity setting at the processing temperature. In one example, the temperature of the press is adjusted to 150° C. and, in the course of compression, increased to 180° C., the pressure is increased to 5 bar after a short melting phase of 3 minutes and held until the removal of the composite component from the press after up to 30 minutes. The hard, rigid, chemicals resistant and impact resistant composite components (sheet products) are tested for the degree of curing (determination by DSC). With the polyurethane composition used, the crosslinking is complete after ca. 20 minutes, and then an enthalpy of reaction for the crosslinking reaction is also no longer detectable.\\n</td>\n",

       "5   Glass fibre nonwovens/fabrics used: The following glass fibre nonwovens/fabrics were used in the examples, glass filament fabric 296 g/m 2 —Atlas, Finish FK 144 (Interglas 92626) Reactive Polyurethane Composition Reactive polyurethane compositions with the following formulae were used for the production of the prepregs and the composites.     The starting materials in the table are intimately mixed in a premixer and then dissolved in the stated solvent. To produce the prepreg, the glass fibre fabric is saturated with the solution of the matrix materials. The prepregs are dried to constant weight in an oven at temperatures of from 50 to 70° C., optionally with application of vacuum. The matrix volume content is determined as 34.2% in Example 1 (10 tests) and 33.9% in Example 2 (6 tests). The fibre volume contents are corresponding 65.8% (Example 1) and 66.1% (Example 2). DSC Measurements The DSC tests (glass transition temperature determinations and enthalpy of reaction measurements) are performed with a Mettler Toledo DSC 821e as per DIN 53765. The DSC studies of the prepregs from Examples 1 and 2 gives the following results:     The glass transition temperatures measured during the second heating procedure are the glass transition temperatures of the fully reacted/crosslinked matrix material. Storage Stability of the Prepregs The DSC studies of the prepregs from Examples 1 and 2 give the following results measured after 18 and, respectively, 40 days, seen in  FIGS. 1 and 2 . The reaction enthalpies measured do not decrease significantly during the course of storage, and this provides evidence of the reactivity of the matrix material. Composite Component Production The composite components are produced on a composite press by a compression technique known to those skilled in the art. The homogeneous prepregs produced by direct impregnation were compressed into composite materials on a benchtop press. This benchtop press is the Polystat 200 T from the firm Schwabenthan, with which the prepregs are compressed to the corresponding composite sheets at temperatures between 120 and 200° C. The pressure is varied between normal pressure and 450 bar. Dynamic compression, i.e. alternating applications of pressure, can prove advantageous for the crosslinking of the fibres depending on the component size, component thickness and polyurethane composition and hence the viscosity setting at the processing temperature. In one example, the temperature of the press is adjusted to 150° C. and, in the course of compression, increased to 180° C., the pressure is increased to 5 bar after a short melting phase of 3 minutes and held until the removal of the composite component from the press after up to 30 minutes. The hard, rigid, chemicals resistant and impact resistant composite components (sheet products) are tested for the degree of curing (determination by DSC). With the polyurethane composition used, the crosslinking is complete after ca. 20 minutes, and then an enthalpy of reaction for the crosslinking reaction is also no longer detectable.\\n   \n",
