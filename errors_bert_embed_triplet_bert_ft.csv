Reduction and hydrogenolysis of 6a-f gave free acids 7a-f, which were coupled with aniline to afford 8a-f.

Crude ligand (20 mg) was dissolved in 1:1 ratio of CH3CN:H2O (1 mL) and injected into the sample injector for elution using RP-PFP (Reverse Phase pentafluorophenyl) preparative column (XSelect CSH Prep Fluorophenyl 5 μm OBD, 19 mm×150 mm). A flow rate of 10 mL/min (mobile phase, A=0.1% trifluoro acetic acid/H2O and B=acetonitrile) is maintained throughout the run and the mobile phase gradient was increased from 1% B (v/v) to 50% B (v/v) over a period of 40 min. The mobile phase gradient was further increased to 80% B (v/v) in the next 15 min and the chromatogram was recorded at λ=200-254 nm as well as by ELSD detector. Pure fractions of 1-3 were collected using automatic fraction collector, acetonitrile was evaporated under reduced pressure, lyophilized to afford pure ligands 1-3. The pure ligands were further used for GCPII enzyme inhibition assay.
