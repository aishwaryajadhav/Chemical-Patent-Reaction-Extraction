00000024|a|TECHNICAL FIELD This patent application claims priority to and the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2017-136943 filed on Jul. 13, 2017, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to a certain type of heterocyclic compound and a harmful-arthropod control agent containing the same. BACKGROUND ART To date, for the purpose of controlling harmful arthropods, various compounds have been studied and come into practical use. Also, a certain class of compound has been known to have an effect on controlling pests (see, for example, Patent Document 1). CITATION LIST Patent Document Patent Document 1: WO 2017/025419 A1 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a compound having an excellent efficacy for controlling harmful arthropods. Means to Solve Problems The present inventors have intensively studied to find compounds having an excellent efficacy for controlling harmful arthropods, and as a result, found that a compound represented by the following formula (I) has an excellent efficacy for controlling harmful arthropods. That is, the present invention is as follows. [1] A compound represented by formula (I):  [wherein: A1 represents CH or a nitrogen atom; R4 represents a C1-C6 alkyl group optionally having one or more halogen atoms; R5 represents CF3, C2F5, or S(O)mCF3; Q represents NR2C(O) OR3 or N‚ïêCR4R6; R2 represents a C1-C6 alkyl group optionally having one or more halogen atoms, a C3-C6 cycloalkyl group optionally having one or more halogen atoms, C(O)OR3 or a hydrogen atom; R3 represents a C1-C6 alkyl group optionally having one or more halogen atoms, a phenyl group optionally having one or more substituents selected from Group D, or a benzyl group optionally having one or more substituents selected from Group D; R4 represents a C1-C6 alkyl
