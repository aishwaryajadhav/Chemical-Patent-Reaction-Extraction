00000000|a|FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical chemistry and pharmaceutical therapeutics, and particularly to a class of 5-aromatic alkynyl substituted benzamide compounds, a preparation method thereof, a pharmaceutical composition containing such compound, and use as a negative allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (MGluR5), in particular use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of central nervous system and psychiatric-related diseases such as fragile X chromosome syndrome, Parkinson's disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia (PD-LID), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), autism, pain, anxiety, depression, drug addiction and the like. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glutamate which is the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals plays an important role in maintaining the normal function of nervous system and also plays an important role in many pathophysiological processes such as pain, neurodegenerative lesions and epilepsy. At the same time, the massive release and accumulation of glutamate in the nervous system is the pathology basis of a variety of nerve cell damage and neurodegenerative disease, i.e., the neurotoxic effect of glutamate, eventually leading to neuronal death. The excitotoxicity lead by glutamate activating its receptor and the oxidative toxicity lead by inhibiting of glutamate / cystine transporters on the cell membrane are the origins of many nervous system diseases such as cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, thus making glutamate receptors become one of the therapeutic targets of these diseases. Glutamate receptors (GluR) are mainly divided into ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist has achieved some therapeutic effect in the animal model by directly blocking the postsynaptic effect of glutamate, but it also blocks normal excitatory transmission and produces serious side effects, such as psychiatric symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, etc., thus limiting the clinical application of such compounds; and metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibit the release of glutamate through the presynaptic mechanism, thus reducing the toxic and side effect of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, and are expected to become a new target for the treatment of certain neurological diseases. mGluRs is one of the members of the C family of the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily. According to its protein sequence homology, receptor-coupled second messenger system signal transduction mechanism and specificity for different agonists, it can be divided into three categories. The first category mGluRI (mGluR1, mGluR5) mainly is distributed in the postsynaptic region, the mGluR1 receptors are also distributed in the glial cells, and the mGluR5 receptors are distributed in the marginal cortex and basal ganglia, which are closely related to the morphology of dendritic spines and play an important role in synaptic transmission and plasticity. The second category mGluR II (mGluR2, mGluR3) mainly locates in the presynaptic region, wherein mGluR2 receptors locate in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, thalamus synaptic axons, mGluR3 receptors are also widely distributed in the brain, including glia. The third category mGluRIII (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, mGluR8) is also distributed in the presynaptic region, mGluR 4/7/8 locates in the basal ganglia movement loop, and mGluR6 receptors are in the retinal neurons. There is about 70% homology in the same mGluR group, and only about 45% homology between the different groups. mGluR5 mainly locates in the neuronal postsynaptic excitatory terminal and glia, couples with GÎ±/q protein, activates phospholipase C, and enhances intracellular Ca2+ release. Studies have shown that mGluR5 is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), mainly in the areas associated with the nervous system and mental illness such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia, etc.. Thus, mGluR5 is one of the important targets for the treatment of central nervous system and psychiatric-related diseases. Regarding to the design of medicine to the target, early studies mainly focused on the design of small molecule competitive antagonists for endogenous ligands, but because of the high conservation degree of the mGlu receptor binding sites, it is difficult to obtain a compound having good selectivity to receptor subtypes. In addition, many endogenous ligands are often glutamic acid derivatives, lacking suitable pharmacokinetic properties and CNS permeability makes these compounds difficult to use in clinical research. In recent years, allosteric modulators of mGlu receptors have attracted widespread attention. Compounds bind to non-endogenous ligand sites, do not directly activate or antagonize receptor function, but indirectly increase or decrease glutamate-induced activity, known as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs). mGlu receptor allosteric modulators act on the allosteric sites of the GPCR transmembrane region, thus providing greater possibilities for overcoming defects in the selectivity and poor permeability of the mGlu receptor endogenous site competitive antagonists. In recent years, mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator has caused great concern of the majority of scientific research workers and major pharmaceutical companies as a potential treatment drug for fragile X chromosome syndrome, such as Parkinson's disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia (PD-LID), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), autism, pain, anxiety, depression, drug addiction and the like. Since 2000, there have been more than 190 mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator patent applications, of which 66 patent applications are filed from 2009 to June 2013; so far at least 9 small molecules have entered the clinical trials, of which 4 compounds are currently undergoing II or III clinical trials such as Mavoglurant, Diproglurant, RG7090 and Fenobam. Therefore, mGluR5 negative allosteric regulatory site is regarded as ideal drug target, while designing novel mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator for the treatment of the central nervous system and psychiatric system-related diseases on this basis has very important significance and good application prospects. In summary, there is an urgent need in the art for the development of novel mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator.

The incidence is about 1/1250 in male and 1/2500 in female. It accounts for 2% -6% of non-specific mental retardation, and 40% of X-associated mental retardation. The clinical symptoms are various degrees of mental retardation, attention deficit, hyperactivity, anxiety with mood swings, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, and can also occur poor coordination of exercise and increased prevalence of epilepsy, as well as other non-neurological symptoms such as unusual face, large ears, excessive joint extension and postpubescent hyperorchidism. The virulence gene-FMR1 was successfully cloned by Verkerk, et al. (1991). The abnormal amplification of (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat sequence at the 5' end of the gene and the abnormal methylation of adjacent site CpG island lead to the transcription and translation termination of FMR1 gene, resulting in the reduction or deletion of the encoded product FMRP, i.e. fragile X mental retardation protein. The emergence of FMR1 knockout mice in 1994 was a milestone in the study of fragile X syndrome. Bakker et al. inserted a neomycin fragment in the FMR1 gene region, thus preventing the gene to express FMRP to produce a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Many behavioral manifestations of FMR1 knockout mice are very similar to those of fragile X syndrome patients, most notably including the increase in spontaneous activity, the decreased open field habit ability, the increase of susceptibility of the audiogenic seizures, and the slight lack of learning ability. For the fragile X chromosome syndrome, there are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of fragile X chromosome syndrome, while the existing treatment such as special education, behavioral therapy, social skills training and drug treatment can improve the prognosis of some affected individuals, and improve the secondary symptoms, but can not effectively solve the the core defects of fragile X chromosome syndrome. Currently, commonly used drugs are mainly large doses of folic acid (which can improve patient's behavior and exercise ability, language quality, but can not improve intelligence obviously, and has no effect for adult patients), antidepressants, central nervous system stimulants (methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, etc., which is effective for improving the lack of attention and excessive activity, but of great side effects) and anti-manic drugs (thioridazine, for the treatment of behavioral and emotional disorders). Fragile X syndrome is caused by the mutation of a single gene FMR1. The FMR1 gene mutation will hinder the expression of protein FMRP, thus leading to the brain FMRP deletion. In normal circumstances, FMRP protein can control or block the mGluR5 activated signaling pathway in brain cells. When FMRP is absent, mGluR5 signal is overactivated, thus causing abnormalities in brain neurons relation and behavior and cognitive impairment associated with fragile X syndrome. The abnormalities of dendritic spine induced by fragile X syndrome may be due to the over-activation of mGluR-I pathway induced by FMRP deletion, which affects intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and protein synthesis. In the experiment, it was observed that when the FMR1 gene knockout mice cultured hippocampal neurons were given mGluRI inhibitor PHCCC, the content of microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) was significantly lower than that of untreated KO mice, thus confirming that the inhibitor could interfere with mGluR-I activation induced protein synthesis. It was also observed that the dendritic spine in the KO mouse inhibitory group was shorter than that in the untreated group, indicating that the inhibitor could partially reverse the dendritic spine morphological abnormality of the fragile X syndrome. This indicated that the mGluR-I inhibitor was able to partially replace the FMRP negative regulation function, thus affecting the function of these proteins. A number of studies have also shown that by specifically inhibiting mGluR5, the symptoms of FXS patients can be significantly improved, thus of good safety and less side effects. Therefore, mGluR5 negative allosteric regulatory site is regarded as ideal drug target for fragile X chromosome, while designing novel mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator for the treatment of such diseases on this basis has very important significance and good application prospects. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refers to a disease that discomfort and/or complications are caused by reflux of gastric contents. In addition to erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma, it also causes chronic cough, chronic laryngitis, bronchial asthma, tooth erosion and other extraesophageal manifestations. Beijing and Shanghai epidemiological survey showed that the prevalence of GERD was as high as 5.77%, which seriously affected the patients' daily work and life quality. With the change of life style and diet, the incidence of GERD in our country is increasing year by year. At present, the main drug for clinical treatment of GERD is proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but there are PPI-resistant patients whose symptoms are not necessarily related to acid. Also, it often leads to recurrence of patients after drug discontinuance, and long-term use also leads to patients adverse reactions. And most of other drugs such as H2 receptor inhibitors, prokinetic agent, visceral pain regulators, antacids, etc. are only effective to mild patients, which limits its clinical application. The traditional treatment drugs can only relieve symptoms to a certain extent, and can not achieve the therapeutic effect for the pathogenesis. Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR) abnormality is one of the main pathogenesis of GERD. Studies have shown that about 90% of reflux in GERD patients is associated with TLESR. Glutamate can convey the sensory information in the intestine to the central nervous system, including the vagal signal that triggers TLESR. Studies have shown that selective mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators can effectively inhibit TLESR, reduce the number of patients reflux, and extend the interval of reflux. Other studies have shown that mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators can reduce colorectal pain sensibility. And visceral hyperalgesia plays a role in functional heartburn and PPI resistance GERD, indicating that it have a certain effect on GERD, especially PPI resistance GERD. Although mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator is promising as anti-reflux drug for the treatment of GERD, but the drugs in the clinical are limited in efficacy, and there are some adverse reactions. Therefore, safe, effective and highly selective mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators need to be developed. Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as tremor paralysis, is the second major central nervous system degenerative diseases after Alzheimer's disease, the main clinical symptoms are exercise retardation, resting tremor, muscle stiffness, gait and posture abnormalities. The widespread use of levodopa has resulted in a more satisfactory control of Parkinson's symptoms, but most patients experience levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) after long-term use (more than five years). LID are often expressed as dance-like movements, dystonia, athetosis, or simple repetitive involuntary movements, the severity often associated with the degree of degenerative lesions of dopaminergic neurons. In PD, since the inhibitory effect of D2 receptor on the striatum-globus pallidus neurons is attenuated, and the glutamate conduction activity of the indirect pathway is significantly enhanced, therefore, reducing the activity of the indirect pathway is the main goal of PD treatment, which can be achieved by inhibition of glutamate neurotransmission. Blocking glutamate receptor activity by the drug can reduce the introduction of glutamatergic neurons, block intrastriatal gene abnormal expression caused by levodopa, and weaken the LID. mGluR5 is highly expressed on the projection neurons of the striatum, but not in the target organ of the autonomic nervous system, which overcomes the adverse effects of the traditional drugs acting directly on the dopamine system. Studies have also shown that mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators can reduce the probability of LID in PD rats; and clinical drugs have also showed that mGluR5 negative allosteric modulators have good safety, tolerance and anti-exercise disorder effectivity.

Physical and chemical properties of the compound  The results show that the physical and chemical properties of these compounds (LogP, CLogP and tPSA, etc.) are comparable to those of the positive drugs, thus leading to good druggability. Example 2. In Vitro Activity Test for mGluR5 Experimental material: HEK293/mGluR5 cell line, Fluo-8 calcium ion fluorescent dye, positive control MPEP, CTEPExperimental instrument: FLIPR Tetra real-time fluorescence imaging analysis systemExperimental method: HDB Fluo-8 calcium fluorescence detection methodExperimental principle: HDB Fluo-8 calcium ion fluorescence detection method is a fast, simple and reliable fluorescence detection method of intracellular calcium concentration changes. The Fluo 8-AM fluorescent dye is an acetyl methyl ester derivative of Fluo 8 which can easily penetrate the cell membrane into the cell by culture. The fluorescent dye into the cell will be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase, the resulting Fluo 8 cannot easily pass through the lipid bimolecular membrane as a polar molecule, and will retain in the cell, and combine with calcium (Ca2+) to produce fluoresces. Cells expressing GPCR receptor protein (mGluR5) were first calibrated with a calcium ion sensitive fluorescent probe and then stimulated with the compound. After stimulation, the activation of the receptor lead to the calcium ion mobilization, and the fluorescent probe captures the calcium ion to induce the fluorescence signal. The signal can be read by a fluorescent plate reader. The fluorescent plate reader contains a sampling head for compound addition, thus enabling the change of the fluorescence value of the compound be read in real time. If the selected compound can activate mGluR5, the calcium flow reaction can be greatly increased; conversely, if the selected compound is able to antagonize mGluR5, the calcium flow reaction can be greatly reduced. Experimental results:  The structures of positive compounds are as follows: Experimental results: In the bioactivity evaluation, we use the tool molecule MPEP as positive control, of which the IC50 value is 4 nM. From the data already obtained in the above table, it can be seen that the IC50 values of some of the newly synthesized compound are comparable to that of the positive control compound, and the IC50 values to mGluR5 of several compounds are less than 10 nM, which show good inhibitory effect on mGluR5.

Example 4. Animal in vivo activity test Experimental principle: Fragile X chromosome syndrome is common genetic disease by mutations during X chromosome formation in the human body, and is the most common genetic cause of autism and mental retardation. The main clinical manifestations include moderate and severe mental retardation, such as lacking of learning ability, cognitive disorder and epilepsy susceptibility. Although it has been confirmed that the pathogenic gene is Fmr1 gene, so far there is no effective intervention and treatment in clinical therapy. Inserting a neomycin fragment in the Fmr1 gene region to prevent the gene to express FMRP can produce a mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Many behavioral manifestations of Fmr1 knockout mice are very similar to those of fragile X syndrome patients, most notably the increased spontaneous activity, decreased open field habit ability, increased susceptibility to the audiogenic seizures, and a slight lack of learning ability. In this study, we used audiogenic epilepsy induced animal model of Fmr1 knockout mice, and evaluated the efficacy of compound ZD043 with epilepsy seizure latency, seizure level and epileptic mortality as evaluation indexes. Laboratory animals and breeding: Species, strain: Fmr1 knockout mice, FVB.129P2-Pde6b+ Tyrc-ch Fmr1tm1Cgr/J (strain number 004624)Age: 19-21 daysWeight: about 7-10gGender: female and maleNumber of animal: 24Feeding conditions: SPF class animal room of Institute of Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, temperature: 22-24 Â°C, humidity: 50-70%, light: 150-300 Lx, 12 hours alternating day and night (7: 00-19: 00 daytime). Test reagent and preparation method: before the experiment, 2.0 mg ZD043 was weighed in 2mL centrifuge tube, 10 uL DMSO was taken with a precise pipette to dissolve ZD043 powder, then 10 uL Tween80 was added, mixed and 980 uL of saline was added, well mixed to form a suspension liquid.Solvent control: 0.9% NaCl solution containing 1% DMSO, 1% Tween 80The main experimental equipment: cylindrical transparent organic glass bucket (diameter 10cm, 25cm high)Video surveillance system: Shanghai Panorama Digital Technology Co., Ltd., Model: IPC-5201-BNSHigh-decibel siren loudspeaker (â¥120 dB): AIDEXIN company, model: ES626Decibel Tester: Tektronix Electronic Instrument Holdings Limited, Model: TM824Methods: The mice were weighed on the day of the experiment. The mice were injected intraperitoneally into 19 to 22 days Fmr1 knockout mice respectively according to the experimental design group 30 minutes before the convulsive test. The mice to be tested were transferred to a sonic seizure test laboratory, placed in a transparent organic glass bucket, and a high-decibel siren loudspeaker was fixed on the top of organic glass bucket. Before delivering the stimulate sound, the mouse was allowed to explore freely for 1 minute, then turn on the loudspeaker, video recorded for the whole process by surveillance system, sound stimulated (â¥120 dB) for 3 minutes, or stop after the animal was died, and the experiment was ended. Test method: After the end of the experiment, the epilepsy seizure latency (2 grade appearance was regarded as seizures, and the longest latency period was recorded as 300 seconds if no epilepsy was observed) and seizure level (Level 0: no epileptic response; Level 1: rapid running and continuous jump; Level 2: paroxysmal epilepsy; Level 3: tonic epilepsy; Level 4: death) were analyzed according to video record. Data processing: calculate the mean and standard error of the epilepsy seizure latency and seizure level as well as the percentage of epilepsy death of each group. The shorter the latency of epilepsy, the higher the incidence level, indicating that the more likely to induce epilepsy, while prolonged latency after drug intervention and a decrease in epilepsy level indicate that the compound can inhibit the occurrence of epilepsy or reduce the degree of epilepsy. After the end of the experiment, the epilepsy seizure latency (2 grade appearance was regarded as seizures, and the longest latency period was recorded as 300 seconds if no epilepsy was observed) and seizure level (Level 0: no epileptic response; Level 1: rapid running and continuous jump; Level 2: paroxysmal epilepsy; Level 3: tonic epilepsy; Level 4: death) were analyzed according to video record. Experimental results:  Conclusion: Compared with the control solvent group, single ZD043 (10 and 20 mg/kg) injection can effectively prolong the seizure latency of audiogenic epilepsy in Fmr1 knockout mice, inhibit seizure level and reduce epilepsy mortality (Veh 100%; ZD043-10mg/kg25%). That is to say compound ZD043 can effectively intervene the behavior phenotype of the audiogenic epilepsy in Fmr1 knockout mice. Example 5. Pharmacokinetic experiment in rats Dosing regimen: Six healthy rats weighing 150-200 g were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 3). The rats were given 10 mL/kg ZD043 by gavage and intravenous injection. The dose of gavage was 20 mg/kg, and the dose of intravenous administration was 10 mg/kg. The drug was formulated in DMSO/Tween 80/saline (5: 5: 90, v/v/v). The rats were fasted for 12 h before testing, and drinked water ad libitum. 2h after administration, all rats ate together. Sampling time point and sample preparation:Gavage administration: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 24h after administration;Intravenous administration: 0, 5 min, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 24h after administration;0.3 mL of blood was collected at the above time points from the rat eye vein venous plexus, placed in heparinized test tube and centrifugated at 11000 rpm for 5 min. Plasma was separated and the sample was frozed in -20Â°C refrigerator. Experimental results:  After the rats were given 20 mg/kg ZD043 by gavage, plasma concentration peak time Tmax was 0.25 h, maximal concentration Cmax was 7124.8 ng/ml; area under the curve AUC0-t was 10491.2 ng Â· h/ml; and terminal elimination half-life t1/2 is 1.302 h. After the rats were administered 10 mg/kg ZD043 by intravenous injection, AUC0-t was 66417.0 ng Â· h/ml; after normalized the dose, the absolute bioavailability of was 31.6% after the rats was given with 20 mg/kg ZD043 by gavage. Experimental conclusion: From the above experimental results, it can be seen that in the rat pharmacokinetic experiments, the compound ZD043 showed a good absolute bioavailability, up to 31.6%. Example 6. Determination of brain tissue content in rats Experimental procedures: Six healthy rats weighing 150-200 g were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 3). The rats were given 10 mL/kg by gavage and intravenous injection, and the dose of gavage was 20 mg/kg, and the dose of intravenous administration was 10 mg/kg. The drug was formulated in DMSO/Tween 80/saline (5: 5: 90, v/v/v). The rats were fasted for 12 h before testing, and drinked water ad libitum. 2h after administration, all rats ate together. 24h after administration, the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the left and right hippocampus, anterior cortex and cortex were removed under ice bath, and frozen in -20Â°C refrigerator. A physiological saline solution was added (1: 10, weight: volume) and the mixture was sufficiently homogenized to form a homogenate. 100 uL homogenate was taken, and 300 uL dichloromethane: methanol (3: 2) solution was added, mixed uniformly through vortex oscillation and centrifugated at 14000 rpm for 10 min. The clear liquor was taken. The sample was dried with nitrogen and stored in the 4Â°C refrigerator. Experimental results:  Experimental conclusion: After administration, the compound ZD043 was rapidly absorbed and crossed the blood-brain barrier to the brain tissue, and the drug concentration ratio in the brain and plasma can reach 1/2. Therefore, compound ZD043 has good brain targeting. Example 7. In Vivo Pharmacodynamics Study - Mouse Tail Suspension Experiment Experimental principle: Tail Suspension Test (TST) is a classic method which can quickly evaluate the efficacy of antidepressant drugs, excitement drugs, and sedative drugs. The principle is to use the status that the mouse give up struggle and enter the unique depression status after the tail was suspended and the attempt to escape was failed. During the experimental process, the immobility time of the animals was recorded to reflect the state of depression, and antidepressants, excitatory drugs can significantly shorten the time. Experimental method: 20-24g male mice were selected and the site at 2cm part from the end of the tail was attached to a horizontal stick, so that the animal entered inverted state, and it's head was about 5cm from the table, and boards were hung on both sides to separate the animal's sight. The immobility time of the administration group and the control group within 6 min were compared. Experimental results: The results were shown in Figure 1. Experimental conclusion: positive control fluoxetine can significantly improve the "immobility time" in the mouse tail suspension test. The compound ZD043 significantly reduced the "immobility time" in the mouse tail suspension test at 20 mg/kg dose. Example 8. In Vivo Pharmacodynamics Study - Head Twitches Test Experimental principle: Model Head Thrust Test (HTT) is first raised by Corne et al. in 1963, head twitches syndrome caused by 5-HT receptor excitement may be mediated through the 5-HT2 receptor. The head twitches behavior induced by 5-HTP in mice is more sensitive to antidepressants with different action mechanisms, such as citalopram, fluvoxamine and other 5-HT retake inhibitors, desipramine, maprotiline, nomifensine and other NA retake inhibitors and imipramine acting on both 5-HT and NA system. Experimental method: 20-24 g male mice were selected. 3h before the test, 100 mg / kg pargyline was intraperitoneal injected and then intraperitoneal injected with test drugs or saline. 5-HTP (5 mg / kg, ip) was injected 30 min later. After 10min, the observation was started and the number of mice head twitches in 6min was recorded. The numbers of the head twitches of experimental group and the saline control group were compared. The experimental results were shown in Figure 2. Experimental conclusion: positive control fluoxetine can significantly improve the "number of head twitches" in the mouse head twitches test. The compound ZD043 was able to increase the "number of head twitches" in the mouse head twitches experiment at 20 mg/kg, which has shown good in vivo pharmacodynamics. Example 9. In vivo pharmacodynamics study - mouse forced swimming experiment Experimental principle: The principle of Mouse Forced Swimming Test (FST) is to allow the mouse to swim in a limited space from which it can not escape, thus inducing animal to non-movement state which reflects the animal's desperate behavior.Experiment name: mouse swimming depression testExperiment objectives: to observe the effect of the test compound on the depressive status of miceExperimental animals: ICR mice, 20-28 g, both male and femaleExperimental equipment: organic glass bucket: cylindrical, 25 cm high, 15 cm inner diameterSample treatment: The test compounds were ground with 1% CMC (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) aqueous solution to prepare a homogeneous solution. In vivo dose was 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, the compound was oral administered at 0.1 ml/10 g volume/body weight. Positive control drugs (amitriptyline and fluoxetine) were dissolved with 0.9% saline, in vivo dose was 10 mg/kg, administered by intraperitoneal injection at 0.1ml/10g volume/body weight. (Note: the mice were fasted for 8 h and drinked water ad libitum before the compound was given.)Experimental Methods: mice were grouped randomly. On the first day the mice with comparable performances were selected after 15 minutes swimming depression modeling. On the second day of the test, the mice were orally administered the compound. After1 hour (0.5 hours after intraperitoneal injection), the mice were then put in water to record the immobility time in the later 4 min of 6 min. The compound was tested whether it can significantly shorten the immobility time of forced swimming mice, thus reflecting whether the test compound has antidepressant effects.Results: (* P <0.05; ** P <0.01, *** P <0.005 vs control.)  The results showed that the positive control amitriptyline can significantly improve the "immobility time" during the forced swimming of mice. The compound ZD043 has reduced the "immobility time" during mouse forced swimming process at varying degrees at dose 5mg/kg, 10mg/kg and 20mg/kg, while the improvement effect increases with the dose increases.
