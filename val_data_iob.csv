"BACKGROUND
",0,US20200115323A1.txt
"Human skin acts as a barrier to physical and chemical stimuli from the external environment. However, in the skin of patients with inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, it can be seen that skin barrier function and/or water retention function in a stratum corneum is significantly reduced compared to normal skin, and the cause of such dysfunction has been found to be due to a reduction of ceramide in the skin (Non-Patent Document
",0,US20200115323A1.txt
"Ceramide, one of sphingolipids, has a structure in which fatty acids are linked to sphingosine, and accounts for 40-50% of intercorneocyte lipids that make up the skin stratum corneum. The skin stratum corneum acts as a protective barrier that protects against penetration of harmful substances or microorganisms from the external environment into the skin tissue. At this time, ceramide forms a layered structure of the skin stratum corneum, and thus has been known to play a central role in maintaining moisture and barrier, which are basic functions of the skin. In maintaining the basic functions of the skin normally, the significance of ceramide has also been proved for a necessity by experimental results that only when the ceramide biosynthesis is inhibited or when the ceramide content is decreased, the barrier function of the skin is not restored, the moisture evaporation of the skin is increased, and various skin diseases are worsened (Non-Patent Document 2). In addition, when the aging of the skin is progressed or the ceramide content is reduced by external stimulation, it has been known that the skin may be restored to be normal by supplementing ceramides.
",0,US20200115323A1.txt
"For the purpose of supplementing such ceramides, searches have been made for natural animals and plants, and microbial systems, and it has been known that the ceramides may be extracted from various animals, plants, and microorganisms (yeasts) containing ceramides. However, the ceramides are present in extremely small amounts in these animals plants, and microorganisms, and the cost of their extract production is too expensive, and solubility in various solvents, cosmetics, and raw materials used in cleaning products is very low. Thus, the synthesis of ceramides with the same structure as natural ceramides or pseudoceramides with similar structures to natural ceramides has been studied by many scientists. Examples thereof include Japanese Patent Documents 1 and 2 of Huawang Co., Ltd. of Japan, and Patent Document 3 of Unilever Co., Ltd. of Germany and Patent Documents 4 and 5 of AMOREPACIFIC, and Patent Document 6 of Aekyung Industrial Co., Ltd. in Korea.
",0,US20200115323A1.txt
"The applicant has made intensified studies of pseudoceramides to find novel pseudoceramide compounds with structural characteristics similar to natural ceramide I and excellent effects of skin protection, moisture retention, or the like, thereby completing the present invention.

"Protein kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation of specific residues of other proteins, and plays an important role in signal-transduction pathways that transduce extracellular signals to the nucleus. Further, it is involved in various diseases in vivo. In the onset or development of inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease, proliferative disease or hyperproliferative disease, and/or immunity mediated disease, there is various evidence that T-cells (or T-lymphocytes) and B-cells (or B-lymphocytes) play an important role.

"Janus kinase (hereinafter referred to as ""JAK"") is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that plays pivotal roles in regulating cell function in the lympho-hematopoietic system. Cytokines are known to play an important role in regulating inflammation, immunity and normal cell function, and JAK activates STAT (Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription) proteins through tyrosine phosphorylation to provide rapid signaling pathways to cytokines. JAK/STAT signaling is known to be associated with allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases (e.g., transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis etc.), solid cancers, blood cancers (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma and so on).
",0,EP3733671A1.txt
"The JAK family is classified into four members: JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3, and TYK 2. Members of the JAK family pair with each other to mediate signals from a variety of cytokines. It includes JAK2 and JAK1 associated with hematopoietic growth factor signaling, and a combination of TYK2 and JAK2 is important for interferon signaling and contributes to host tolerance. JAK2 can induce anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, especially when it is involved in the hematopoietic growth factor signaling and causes excessive inhibition.
",0,EP3733671A1.txt
"The expression of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 was found to be widely distributed, whereas the expression of JAK3 was restricted to lymphocytes and is associated with signaling for the common gamma chains, members of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 receptors, particularly the common gamma chain of the IL-2 family. As soon as the cytokine is bound, the receptor carries adjacent JAK3 nearby, which induces autophosphorylation of the β-chain C-terminus. As a result, it causes activation of the STAT protein, which is an important step in retransmitting the signal to the nucleus. JAK3 controls the signal pathways of various cytokines through this process. This makes JAK3 as an attractive target for immunosuppression.

"B cells play an important role in the development of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. Protein-based therapeutic agents that reduce B cells, for example Rituxan, are effective in autoantibody-induced inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, protein kinase inhibitors that play a role in B cell activation are useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of B cell-mediated diseases, for example, for the production of autoantibodies.

"Signal transduction through B cell receptor (BCR) regulates various B cell responses, including proliferation and differentiation into mature antibody-producing cells.

"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (hereinafter, referred to as ""BTK"") is an important regulator of the development, activation, signaling and survival of B-cells. BTK is involved in signal transduction pathways initiated by binding various extracellular ligands to their cell surface receptors. Following ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), the activity of BTK by the coincident action of the protein tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk is required for the induction of the phospholipase C-γ2-mediated calcium mobilization. Therefore, inhibition of BTK can be a useful therapeutic approach in blocking the onset process of B-cell mediated diseases.

"As mentioned above, Janus kinase and TEC-based kinases play an important role in the activation of T-cells and/or B-cells involved in the development of inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases or hyperproliferative diseases, and immunity mediated diseases.

"This invention relates to benzothiazepine and benzothiadiazepine derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts and prodrugs thereof. These benzothiazepines and benzothiadiazepines possess ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitory activity and accordingly have value in the treatment of disease states associated with hyperlipidaemic conditions and they are useful in methods of treatment of a warm-blooded animal, such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said benzothiazepine and benzothiadiazepine derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments to inhibit IBAT in a warm-blooded animal, such as man.

"It is well-known that hyperlipidaemic conditions associated with elevated concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are major risk factors for cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease (for instance ""Coronary Heart Disease: Reducing the Risk; a Worldwide View"" Assman G., Carmena R. Cullen P. et al; Circulation 1999, 100, 1930-1938 and ""Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association"" Grundy S, Benjamin I., Burke G., et al; Circulation, 1999, 100, 1134-46). Interfering with the circulation of bile acids within the lumen of the intestinal tracts is found to reduce the level of cholesterol. Previous established therapies to reduce the concentration of cholesterol involve, for instance, treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, preferably statins such as simvastatin and fluvastatin, or treatment with bile acid binders, such as resins. Frequently used bile acid binders are for instance cholestyramine and cholestipol. One recently proposed therapy (""Bile Acids and Lipoprotein Metabolism: a Renaissance for Bile Acids in the Post Statin Era"" Angelin B, Eriksson M, Rudling M; Current Opinion on Lipidology, 1999, 10, 269-74) involved the treatment with substances with an IBAT inhibitory effect.

"Re-absorption of bile acid from the gastro-intestinal tract is a normal physiological process which mainly takes place in the ileum by the IBAT mechanism. Inhibitors of IBAT can be used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia (see for instance ""Interaction of bile acids and cholesterol with nonsystemic agents having hypocholesterolaemic properties"", Biochemica et Biophysica Acta, 1210 (1994) 255- 287). Thus, suitable compounds having such inhibitory IBAT activity are also useful in the treatment of hyperlipidaemic conditions. Substituted compounds possessing such IBAT inhibitory activity have been described, see for instance hypolipidaemic compounds described in WO 93/16055, WO 94/18183, WO 94/18184, WO 96/05188, WO 96/08484, WO 96/16051, WO 97/33882, WO 98/38182, WO 99/35135, WO 98/40375, WO 99/35153, WO 99/64409, WO 99/64410, WO 00/01687, WO 00/4756S, WO 00/61565, WO 01/68906, DE 19825804, WO 00/38725, WO 00/38726, WO 00/38727, WO 00/38728, WO 00/38729, WO 01/68906 and EP 0 864 582.

"It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group.

The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.

"BACKGROUND ART

"In eukaryote from yeast to human, a decomposition process for recycling or metabolizing unnecessary cellular component such as protein and organelle called autophagy exists universally. Autophagy has been considered to be a mechanism for surviving a starved state by decomposing oneself non-selectively for securing the nutrition in a nutrition-starved state, however, later study revealed that it involves maintenance of homeostasis, programmed cell death in ontogenic process, suppression of diseases such as Huntington's disease, suppression of canceration of cells through removing denatured protein, preventing accumulation of excess mount of protein produced in the cells, removing deteriorated organelle or pathogenic microorganisms.
",0,US20200172489A1.txt
"It is known that autophagy has a plurality of processes with different mechanisms such as macro autophagy, micro autophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Early research using an electron microscope revealed that, in macro autophagy, a separation membrane composed of bilayer membrane gradually extends to encapsulate degradation substrates such as unnecessary substances to form autophagosomes, and then the content of the autophagosome is decomposed by digestive enzyme in autolysosomes formed by fusing the autophagosome and lysosomes. Any processes are common in that the decomposition substrate is migrated into lysosome, where it is subjected to decompose.
",0,US20200172489A1.txt
"In recent years, molecular mechanism of the autophagy has been elucidated and genes associated with autophagy have been identified. As a method for detecting autophagy, a method in which cells are lysed and the expression level of factors associated with autophagy from mRNA obtained is determined by a Western Blot method or immunostaining method is known (for example, see Patent Literature 1). However, this method cannot be applied to a cell live imaging since cells are lysed in this method.

"As methods for detecting autophagy in living cells, introducing a plasmid vector coding LC3-GFP in which GFP is incorporated into LC3, a kind of gene product involving the formation of the autophagosomes (Atg protein) into cells and monitoring the expression of LC3 by a luminescence of GFP (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 1). Since the fluorescent intensity of GFP decreases under acidic condition, it is superior for detecting the early stage of autophagy. However, this method cannot be applied to any kind of cells since it requires expression of LC3-GFP in the cells.
",0,US20200172489A1.txt
"A typical intracellular imaging method includes a method in which an intensity of fluorescence from a pH responsive fluorescent protein called Keima expressed in the cells (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 2) is monitored. The excitation spectrum of Keima varies in accordance with pH. A short wavelength (440 nm) peak is predominant in a neutral environment, whereas a long wavelength (550 nm) peak is predominant in an acidic environment. In a ratio (550 nm/440 nm) image obtained from two images measured using these two different excitation wavelengths, Keima in the neutral environment shows lower ratio value, whereas Keima in the acidic environment shows higher ratio value. Using this phenomenon, each step of autophagy (formation of autophagosome, fusion with lysosomes etc.) may be detected by reading out the pH change of the decomposition substrate associated with autophagy from the fluorescence image. However, this method is not applicable to all kinds of cells because the expression of Keima in the cells is required.

"On the other hand, a method using monodansyl cadaverin (MDC) is known as an example of a method for detecting autophagy using low molecular fluorescent dye (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 3). However, the excitation wavelength of MDC is in an ultraviolet region, which may cause problems of cytotoxicity and breaching. Recently, CYTO-ID (Trademark) has been developed by Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. as a novel dye by which the problems of MDC have been solved (see Non-Patent Literature 4).

"BACKGROUND
",0,US20180065917A1.txt
"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) is a 40 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein. PD-L1 is expressed on a variety of cell types, including placenta, vascular endothelium, pancreatic islet cells, muscle, hepatocytes, epithelium, and mesenchymal stem cells, as well as on B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells. Interaction of PD-L1 with programmed death receptor (PD-1; also known as CD279) expressed on T cells (particularly on activated T cells) results in reduced T-cell proliferation and cytokine expression to help control local inflammatory responses and maintain self-tolerance. Tumor cells have co-opted the PD-1/PD-L1 regulatory mechanism to avoid immunologic surveillance, facilitating cancer growth.
",0,US20180065917A1.txt
"Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction would restore the function of chronically exhausted tumor-specific T cells and decrease tumor-induced immune suppression.
",0,US20180065917A1.txt
"General examples of PD-L1 antagonists or inhibitors include an antibody or antigen-binding fragment or small molecule that specifically binds to PD-L1 and reduces one or more of its immune-suppressive activities, for example, its binding to the PD-1 receptor. Specific examples of PD-L1 antagonists include the antibodies atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), avelumab (MSB0010718C), and durvalumab (MEDI4736), and antigen-binding fragments thereof.
",0,US20180065917A1.txt
"However, there remains a significant need for compounds that effectively and specifically inhibit the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 in a clinical setting, as well as for associated compositions and methods. The present invention satisfies this need and provides further related advantages.

"SUMMARY
",0,US20180065917A1.txt
"The present invention generally relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of the functional interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and CD80 (B7-1). Such compounds may either completely disrupt binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and/or CD80 or block or attenuate signal transduction through these receptors. Inhibitors of the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 are useful in the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases.

"The term “prodrug” refers to a precursor of a drug, a compound which upon administration to a patient must undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming an active pharmacological agent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis. Typical examples of prodrugs include compounds that have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety of the active compound. Prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated, dephosphorylated to produce the active compound. Exemplary prodrugs of compounds in accordance with Formula (I) are esters, acetamides, and amides.

Illustrative of such isotopes are 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 31p, 32P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I, and 125I, respectively. These radiolabeled compounds can be used to measure the biodistribution, tissue concentration and the kinetics of transport and excretion from biological tissues including a subject to which such a labeled compound is administered. Labeled compounds are also used to determine therapeutic effectiveness, the site or mode of action, and the binding affinity of a candidate therapeutic to a pharmacologically important target. Certain radioactive-labeled compounds according to Formula (I), therefore, are useful in drug and/or tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.

"Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from the greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life of compounds containing deuterium. Substitution of hydrogen with deuterium may reduce dose required for therapeutic effect, and hence may be preferred in a discovery or clinical setting. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 1C, 18F, 5O and 13N, provides labeled analogs of the inventive compounds that are useful in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, e.g., for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds according to Formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Preparations and Examples section as set out below using an appropriate isotopic-labeling reagent.

"To further transform intermediate biphenyls of Formula III to the biphenyl bis-ethers of Formula IV, the R1a group must first be converted to a hydroxymethylene moiety if not already in place. Intermediate IIIA (R1a is CH2OH) can then be subjected to an ether forming reaction with an appropriate phenol under Mitsunobu conditions to form biphenyl bis-ethers of Formula IV where R1b is CH2OH, CH2OPG, CHO, CO2R2, CH2NH2 or CH2NHPG. For a review of the Mitsunobu reaction see Fletcher, S., Org. Chem. Front. 2015, 2, 739.

"Functional group R1b of intermediate IV can either then be used to directly incorporate the substituted alkyl groups designated as (CH2)nY1 of Formula I, or first converted to an alternative functional group required to transform IV to I. For example when R1b is an aldehyde it may be subjected to reductive alkylation or carbon homologation transformations.

"All synthetic chemistry was performed in standard laboratory glassware unless indicated otherwise in the examples. Commercial reagents were used as received. Microwave reactions were performed in a Biotage Initiator using the instrument software to control heating time and pressure. Analytical LC/MS was performed on an Agilent 1290 infinity, Mass:6150 SQD(ESI/APCI) or an Agilent 1200 SERIES, Mass:6130SQD(ESI/APCI); variable wavelength detector and Agilent 6130 single quadrupole mass spectrometer, alternating positive and negative ion scans using Chemistation software. Retention times were determined from the extracted 220 nm UV chromatogram. HPLC was performed on a Waters 2695 system with a variable wavelength detector using Empower software. Retention times were determined from the extracted 210 nm and 300 nm UV chromatograms. 1H NMR was performed on a Bruker Avance 400 at 400 MHz or a Bruker Avance DRX-500 at 500 MHz using Topspin software. For complicated splitting patterns, the apparent splitting was tabulated. Analytical thin layer chromatography was performed on silica (Macherey-Nagel ALUGRAM Xtra SIL G, 0.2 mm, UV254 indicator) and was visualized under UV light. Silica gel chromatography was performed manually, or with Grace automated chromatography for gradient elution. Melting points were collected using a Biichi B-540 melting point apparatus.

The PD-1-Fc coated plates were incubated with PD-L1 and compound solution for 2 hours on a shaker at room temperature. After the incubation unbound PD-L1 was washed away with PBST and plates were incubated with the blocking buffer for 10 minutes. The bound PD-L1-Fc-biotin was detected with streptavidin-HRP and TMB substrate.

"2. Description of the Related Art
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"Therapies with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities hold the potential to effectively treat the majority of diseases. Oxidative stress causes over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, tumor growth and age-related diseases. Inflammatory diseases decrease the quality of life of many patients. However, the current medicinal drugs aimed at combatting inflammatory diseases or treating related symptoms are not always effective and may cause serious adverse effects. Finally, even as infectious diseases are among the world's leading causes of death, antimicrobial resistance has been commonly reported worldwide.

Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This result can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous materials with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.

"As will be shown, exemplary coumarin derivatives were synthesized and their biological activities as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant agents were assessed. Pyranocoumarin and coumarin sulfonamide derivatives prepared according to schemes 1 and 2 are described herein. Synthetic scheme 1, shown in FIG. 3, is a procedure for preparation of the pyranocoumarin compounds having general formula 2. The pyranocoumarins 5a-b were prepared in high yields according to a previously reported method (Kiyani and Ghorbani, “Efficient tandem synthesis of a variety of pyran-annulated heterocycles, 3,4-disubstituted isoxazol-5(4H)-ones, and α,β-unsaturated nitriles catalyzed by potassium hydrogen phthalate in water”, Res Chem Intermed 41, 7847-7882, 2015). Carboxamide derivatives 6a-b were obtained in good yields through acidic hydrolysis of 5a or 5b, respectively. The reaction of 5a-b with excess N,N-dimethylformamide-dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA) at 100° C. yielded the corresponding derivatives 7a-b within 15-40 minutes. Microwave irradiation was used to obtain the target derivatives 8a-f by treatment of 5a-b with different aromatic aldehydes in 1,4-dioxane. Optimized irradiation time using a microwave synthesizer (e.g., Biotage® Initiator+ microwave, 400 W) was found to be 90 to 110 minutes for this reaction. The products were therefore obtained in short reaction time without use of a hazardous catalyst at yields of 17-37%, except compound 8f, which was obtained at a yield of <6%.
",2,US10730885B1.txt
"Synthetic scheme 2, shown in FIGS. 4A-4D, is a procedure for preparation of coumarin-3-sulfonamide compounds. Coumarin sulfonyl chlorides 9a-b were prepared by treating the 4-hydroxy-6-substituted coumarins 4a or 4b with chlorosulfonic acid in dichloromethane at 0° C., resulting in high yields of ≥97%. The coumarin-3-sulfonamides were generally obtained either by using a Knoevenagel type of condensation reaction or through condensation of coumarin-3-sulfonyl chlorides with aromatic amines. Preparation of corresponding coumarin-3-sulfonamides 10a-f was achieved by refluxing a preferably equimolar quantity of 9a or 9b with a sulfa-drug in absolute ethanol. Reaction of 9a or 9b with a nucleophilic reagent, aniline or p-substituted aniline, in absolute ethanol under reflux produced corresponding coumarin-3-sulfonamides 11a-f in yields of 48-92%. Claisen-Schmidt condensation of p-acetyl derivatives of 4-hydroxy-6-(substituted)coumarin-3-sulfonamides 11e or 11f with the p-substituted aromatic aldehyde through the addition of sodium hydroxide solution in ethanol at room temperature resulted in corresponding coumarin-sulfonamide chalcone derivatives 12a-f at yields of 15-35%.

"Scheme 1, shown in FIG. 3, and Scheme 2, shown in FIGS. 4A-4D, depict the methods of synthesizing the present coumarin derivatives. The starting material 4-hydroxy-6-methylcoumarin 4b was synthesized according to the method reported by Shah et al., “Communication-New Synthesis of 4-Hydroxycoumarins”. J. Org. Chem. 25, 677-678 (1960). The other starting material 6-chloro-4-hydroxycoumarin 4a was obtained commercially from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). All other reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. Melting points (° C.) were determined in open glass capillaries using Electrothermal melting point apparatus (UK) and are uncorrected. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on SHIMADZU FT/IR S1 Plus spectrometer (Germany) using potassium bromide (KBr) discs and expressed in wave number υ (cm−1). NMR spectra were obtained on an Agilent Technologies 600 Ultra Shield NMR spectrometer (Santa Clara, USA) at 600 MHz for 1H and 154 MHz for 13C. The chemical shifts are expressed in δ (ppm) with reference to tetramethylsilane (TMS). Coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hz. Deuteriochloroform (CDCl3) and deuteriodimethylsulphoxide (DMSO-d6) were used as solvents. The splitting patterns were designated as: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet) and br. s (broad singlet). The NMR spectra of compounds 5a, 7a, 8d, 12c, 12d and 12f were obtained on a Bruker Ascend 700 NMR spectrometer (Fallanden, Switzerland) at 700.17 MHz for 1H and 176.08 MHz for 13C. Electron impact mass spectra (EI-MS) were recorded on a Shimadzu GC-MS-QP 2010 instrument (Germany) at 70 eV. Microwave reaction was conducted using a Biotage microwave reactor (Biotage® Initiator+, EXP EU, 400 W, 2450 MHz). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed for monitoring the reactions and checking the purity of the final products using silica gel precoated aluminum sheets (60 F254, Merck) and visualization with Ultraviolet light (UV) at 365 and 254 nm.

"In summary, compounds 11c, 11d, 11a and 11b demonstrated particularly high antioxidant activity. Compounds 10a, 10c, 10d, 11a, 11c, 11d, 12c and 12d exhibited antimicrobial activity equal to or higher than the standard antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin and ketoconazole) against one or more microorganisms. In particular, compound 10d showed a broad-spectrum activity against all of the tested microorganisms. Compounds 6a, 5b, 8c, 12a and 6b showed more potent in vitro anti-proteinase activity than aspirin, and compounds 8d, 8e, 10f, 11a and 11c showed as potent anti-proteinase activity as aspirin, with compound 6a showing significant in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. These compounds, except 8c, 10c and 12c, followed the in silico criteria for orally active drug, and therefore they will be studied in vivo to be developed as orally active agents. The potent compounds such as 11c, 10d and 6a may serve as “lead compound” to develop more potent and high-efficiency antioxidant, antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory agents.

"The antioxidant activity of the synthesized compounds was measured in terms of hydrogen-donating or radical scavenging ability using the DPPH microplate-based method. Absorbance measurement was obtained using Microplate/cuvette reader (Spectramax M5, Molecular Devices, California, USA). Reference standard compound ascorbic acid was used as the positive control for this assay at concentrations ranging from 1.563 to 200 μg/mL. Test samples were prepared at a starting concentration of 200 μg/mL after mixing with 100 μl of 0.2 mM DPPH methanolic solution. A series of concentrations were tested for the samples in order to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Samples were incubated with DPPH in the dark for 30 min at room temperature (25° C.). The DPPH solution in methanol was prepared daily and stored in a flask covered with aluminum foil. DPPH radicals have an absorption maximum (λmax) at 515 nm, in which the absorbance values were measured and converted into percentage of antioxidant activity.

"Antioxidant effects of test sample compounds prepared according to the exemplary synthetic methods, as well as ascorbic acid control, were obtained by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant assay and are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Fourteen of the test sample compounds were found to have radical scavenging activity, and dose dependent antioxidant activity was observed for all compounds having antioxidant activity.

Similarly, the coumarin-sulfonamide derivatives 10a-f had comparable activities to compounds 6b and 8d, with the IC50 values in the range of 61-120 μg/mL. Significant antioxidant activity was observed in compounds 11a-f, with IC50 values in the range of 3-35 μg/mL, compounds 11e and 11d being the most potent among this series.

"Based on the experimental results, the pyranocoumarins 6b and 8d have good radical scavenging activity, possibly related to the presence of a furyl ring at position 4 of the coumarin base structure. Compound 6b exhibits superior antioxidant activity, possibly due to the presence of an amino group and carboxamide at positions 2 and 3, respectively. However, the remaining pyranocoumarin compounds, synthesized as above, showed relatively poor antioxidant activity.

"Of the exemplarily synthesized coumarin-3-sulfonamides, generally, the chloro-substituted compounds at 6-position of the base coumarin ring show higher radical scavenging potential than the analogous methyl-substituted compounds. Interestingly, compounds 11c and 11d exhibit the highest antioxidant activity. The presence of the phenolic hydroxyl group might explain this optimal activity. Compounds 11a, 11b, 11e, and 11f show good radical scavenging potential relative to standard control ascorbic acid.

"The newly synthesized compounds were individually tested for their in vitro anti-inflammatory activity against proteinase enzyme. In addition, compounds 5b, 6b, 10f and 11c have been tested in vivo for their acute anti-inflammatory activity using formaldehyde-induced paw oedema method in rats.
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"For proteinase inhibitory activity, the reaction mixture (2 ml) contained 0.06 mg trypsin, 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and 1 ml test sample (250 μg/ml for each compound). The mixture was incubated for 5 min and then 1 ml of 0.8% (w/v) casein was added. The mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min. 1 ml of 10% perchloric acid was added to arrest the reaction. The cloudy suspension was centrifuged, and the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 280 nm. Reference standard compound aspirin was used as the positive control for this assay. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Percentage inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated by using the following formula:

"Proteinases play a significant role in inflammatory reactions, particularly in the context of arthritic reactions. Proteinases typically are sequestered in lysosomal granules of neutrophils and provide significant protection against tissue damage and proteolytic activity of neutrophils during inflammatory reactions.
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"The assayed proteinase inhibitory activity of the target compounds is summarized in Tables 9 and 10. The inhibition of proteinase activity at 250 μg/ml for each compound is highest in compounds 6a and 5b, with inhibition values of 79.72±4.51% and 74.68±3.01%, respectively. Compounds 8c and 12a also have high percentage inhibition values of 68.5±6.23% and 62.14±4.87%, respectively. Compounds 6b, 8d, 8e, 10f, 11a and 11c show percentage inhibition values in the range of 41-49%. Compounds 7a, 7b, 10d and 12d show modest proteinase inhibitory activity with the percentage inhibition values in the range of 31-36%. The remaining compounds show relatively weak anti-proteinase activity with percentage inhibition values below 30%. Compound 12b, shows negligible, if any, anti-proteinase activity at the tested concentration.
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"The pyranocoumarins 6a, 5b, 8c and 6b showed more potent anti-proteinase activity than the control anti-inflammatory, aspirin. Meanwhile, compounds 8d and 8e were comparable to the control. The remaining compounds of this series showed moderate-to-poor anti-proteinase activity. Compound 5a, which features a 4-nitrophenyl moiety, shows weak anti-proteinase activity, while replacement of the cyano group of 5a with carboxamide (6a) significantly enhances the proteinase inhibitory activity. In addition, replacement of the protons of the amino group with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene and 2,4-dichlorobenzylidene (8c and 8e, respectively) seem to significantly enhance the proteinase inhibitory activity. This suggests that the 4-nitrophenyl alone in the pyranocoumarin does not contribute to a significant anti-proteinase activity, but its presence enhances such activity synergistically with a carboxamide, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene or 2,4-dichlorobenzylidene group. In contrast, compound 5b, containing furan-2-yl, shows significant anti-proteinase activity while hydrolysis of the cyano group to give carboxamide (6b) or replacement of protons of the amino group with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylidene or 2,4-dichlorobenzylidene (8d and 8f) reduces the activity by more than 25%. Compounds 7a and 7b exhibit modest anti-proteinase activity. This is likely due to the presence of N,N-dimethyl formimidamide at position 2 of the pyrano ring.
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"Regarding the coumarin-3-sulfonamides, only compound 12a exhibits higher anti-proteinase activity than aspirin. The presence of the chloro substituent at position 6 of the coumarin ring, along with the 4-nitrophenyl in the chalcone moiety, may contribute to this activity. Conversely, replacement of this chloro substituent with methyl diminishes the anti-proteinase activity. Compounds 10f, 11a and 11c possess comparable activity to that of aspirin. The remaining coumarin-3-sulfonamides exhibit modest-to-poor anti-proteinase activity. The presence of a methyl moiety at position 6, along with a pyrimidine or thiazole ring in compounds 10d and 10f, seems to play a strong role in their anti-proteinase activity. Replacement of the methyl moiety with a chloro moiety, or the pyrimidine or thiazole ring with hydrogen, significantly reduces the activity. Compounds 11e and 11f show poor anti-proteinase activity due to the presence of 4-acetylphenyl at position 3 of the coumarin rings. Compounds 11a and 11c have significant anti-proteinase activity that could be due to the presence of the chloro moiety and the phenyl and 4-hydroxyphenyl at positions 6 and 3, respectively, of the coumarin ring. In contrast, replacement of the chloro moiety with methyl may reduce the anti-proteinase activity significantly. Compounds 12e and 12f exhibit weak anti-proteinase activity that might be due to the presence of 4-methoxyphenyl in the chalcone moiety. Compound 12d, containing methyl and 4-chlorophenyl, shows modest anti-proteinase activity. Meanwhile, compound 12c, containing chloro and 4-chlorophenyl, exhibits poor activity.

"Testing was performed to determine formaldehyde-induced rat paw oedema (edema). For the formaldehyde-induced rat paw oedema (edema) test, female Wister albino rats (150-175 g) were used for determination of the anti-inflammatory activities. The rats were obtained from the animal house colony of the National Organization for Drug Control and Research (NODCAR), Egypt. The animals were kept in standard plastic cages in an air conditioned room at 22±3° C., 55±5% humidity and supplied with standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum. All animal experimental procedures were carried out according to the Ethics Committee of the National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt and followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health, Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1985). The rats were classified into the following groups (6 rats each): (1) positive control group, in which paw oedema was induced by 0.2 ml (1%, w/v) of formaldehyde injected in the sub-plantar area of the right hind paw of the rat; and (2) prophylactic groups, in which all drug regimens were given one hour before induction of paw oedema, the groups including an indomethacin reference group where rats were given indomethacin orally in dose of 25 mg/kg, and test groups where rats were given coumarins 5b, 6a, 10f and 11c orally in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg each.

"A correlation was not observed between antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities and in silico estimated lipophilicity for the present compounds (Tables 11 and 12). On the other hand, a correlation was observed between the antimicrobial activity and the in silico estimated lipophilicity. However, increasing the lipophilicity of compounds allows better penetration through microbial cell membranes, thereby increasing antimicrobial activity. In fact, only compound 10b was inactive against all tested microorganisms, showing the lowest consensus Log P value (1.05) amongst all the tested compounds. The lack of microbial activity of 10b could be due to the low Log P value of this compound. Meanwhile, the remaining compounds, which have mild to strong activity against one or more microorganisms, have consensus Log P values in the range of 1.23-5.33. Lipophilicity is not the only factor influencing the biological activity; other factors, such as electronic effects and steric properties, may also contribute to the biological activity of the tested compounds.

"Drug-Likeness Assessment
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"In order to assess the drug-likeness of the newly synthesized compounds, in silico Lipinski Rule of Five (RO5) and topological polar surface area (TPSA) analysis were conducted using Molinspiration, an online cheminformatics software which provide web-based interactive calculation of molecular properties like molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors as well as acceptors and calculated partition coefficient of the molecules.
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"It has been reported that 90% of orally active compounds that reached phase II clinical trials or higher satisfy Lipinski's rule of five. This rule states that a molecule likely to be developed as an orally active drug candidate should not show more than one violation of the following four criteria: Molecular weight: ≤500, octanol-water coefficient (Log P): ≤5, H-bond donors (n-OHNH): ≤5 and H-bond acceptors (n-ON): ≤10 (Lipinski et al., “Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in drug discovery and development settings” Adv Drug Deliv Rev 23, 3-25, 1997). Despite the importance of RO5 to label a molecule as ‘drug-like’, these criteria are restricted to the issue of oral bioavailability via passive transport only. In addition, TPSA is another major factor for predicting oral availability of compounds, and its values for intestinal absorption showed be less than 140 Å2 (Clark, 1999).
",0,US10730885B1.txt
"The results in Table 13 and 14 showed that all compounds have less than or equal to 4 hydrogen bond donors. The number of hydrogen bond acceptors is less than or equal to ten for all compounds except compounds 8c, 10c and 10d. The molecular weight of compounds 8c, 8e, 10c, 10e, 12a-c, 12e is shown to be more than 500 daltons. The octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) is not more than 5 for all compounds except compounds 8a, 8e, 8f, 12c and 12d. These results indicate that all compounds are capable of being developed as an orally active drug candidate except compounds 8c, 8e, 10c, 12c and 12e, which violate the RO5 criteria. However, some drugs in clinical use do not obey the RO5 criteria. The TPSA is less than 140 Å2 in all compounds except 6a, 10a-f, 12a and 12b, which indicates likely easy permeability through the intestinal cell membrane. Based on these findings and the results of the biological tests, all tested compounds followed the in silico criteria for an orally active drug. In light of the demonstrated biological activities above, the compounds are particularly suited for use as orally active agents.

"Chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation are two ways commonly used in the treatment of cancers. The two therapies both cause DNA single strand and/or double strand break, and thus exert a cytotoxic effect, resulting in the death of target tumor cells due to chromosome damage. In response to DNA damage, an important consequence is the activation of cell cycle checkpoint signaling for the purpose of protecting the cells against mitosis in case of DNA damage, thereby avoiding cell damage. In most cases, the tumor cells have a high proliferation rate while exhibiting deficiency in cell cycle checkpoint signaling. Therefore, it can be inferred that a specific mechanism of DNA repair exists in the tumor cells, which may rapidly respond to and repair the chromosome damage associated with proliferation regulation, such that the tumor cells survive the cytotoxic effect of some therapeutic agent.
",0,EP3284743A1.txt
"In clinical use, the concentration of the chemotherapeutic agent or the intensity of the radiation is effective for counteracting the mechanism of DNA repair, to ensure the killing effect on target tumor cells. However, resistance to treatment may be developed in the tumor cells through a strengthened mechanism of DNA damage repair, such that the tumor cells survive the fatal DNA damage. To overcome the resistance development, the dose of the therapeutic agent or the intensity of the radiation is generally required to be enhanced. This has a detrimental effect on normal tissues around the lesion, whereby serious adverse effects are implicated during treatment, and the treatment risk is increased. Meanwhile, the therapeutic effect is decreased with increasing resistance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the cytotoxic effect of a DNA damaging agent may be improved in a tumor cell-specific manner by regulating the DNA damage signaling and repair mechanism.
",0,EP3284743A1.txt
"Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARPs) characterized by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity constitute a super family of 18 intranuclear and cytoplasmic enzymes. Through this poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, the catalytic activity of target proteins and the protein-protein interactions may be modulated, and some fundamental biological processes are regulated, including DNA repair, and cell death. Moreover, the genomic stability also correlates with the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
",0,EP3284743A1.txt
"PARP-1 activity accounts for about 80% of the total PARP activity in the cells. PARP-1 and PARP-2 closest thereto are members in the PARP family that have an ability to repair the DNA damage. As a sensor and signaling protein of DNA damage, PARP-1 can quickly detect and directly bind to the site of DNA damage, followed by inducing the aggregation of numerous proteins required for DNA repair, such that the DNA damage is repaired. When PARP-1 is deficient in the cells, PARP-2 is able to repair the DNA damage in place of PARP-1. Studies show that compared with normal cells, PARPs are expressed at a generally increased level in solid tumors. Furthermore, cancers (e.g. breast and ovary cancer) which are deficient in DNA repair-related genes (e.g. BRCA-1 or BRCA-2) are extremely sensitive to the PARP-1 inhibitor, indicating that the PARP inhibitor, as a single therapeutic agent, is potentially useful in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. Moreover, since the mechanism of DNA damage repair is a principal mechanism through which resistance is developed in the tumor cells counteracting the chemotherapeutic agent and ionizing radiation. Accordingly, PARP-1 is considered to be a target of interest in seeking a new method for treating cancers.
",0,EP3284743A1.txt
"The PARP inhibitors that are developed and designed previously are analogues developed with nicotinamide of NAD that is a substrate for PARP as a template. These inhibitors are competitive inhibitors of NAD, which compete with NAD for the catalytic sites of PARP, thereby hindering the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) chain. Without the modification with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, PARP cannot be cleaved from the site of DNA damage, such that other proteins involved in repair cannot access the site of damage and thus the repair process cannot be performed. Therefore, under attack of cytotoxic agents or radiation, the presence of the PARP inhibitor ultimately leads to the death of tumor cells with impaired DNA.
",0,EP3284743A1.txt
"In addition, NAD, consumed as a substrate for PARP, is essential to the synthesis of ATP in cells. At a high level of PARP activity, the intracellular NAD level decreases dramatically, thus affecting the ATP level in cells. Due to the inadequate content of ATP in the cells, the cells are failed in ATP-dependent programmed cell death, and have to turn to necrosis, a special apoptosis process. During necrosis, a large amount of inflammatory factors are released, causing a toxic effect to other organs and tissues. Therefore, the PARP inhibitor may find use in the treatment of many diseases associated with such a mechanism, including neurodegenerative diseases (for example, senile dementia, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease), diabetes, ischemia or complications during ischemic reperfusion, for example, myocardial infarction and acute renal failure, diseases of circulatory system, for example, septic shock, and inflammatory diseases such as chronic rheumatism.

"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins is a post-translational modification occurred in response to DNA damage. PARP is the abbreviation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which catalyzes the attachment of poly(ADP-ribose) to an adjacent nuclear protein in the presence of NAD, thus eliciting a mechanism of DNA repair through base excision repair pathway. The level of biotin-labeled ADP-ribose binding to histone can be detected by using the HT Universal Chemiluminescent PARP Assay Kit commercially available from Trevigen Corp.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,EP3305788A1.txt
"JAK belongs to a family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6. The present invention also provides methods for the production of the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, methods for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases involving inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6 by administering a compound of the present invention.
",0,EP3305788A1.txt
"Janus kinases (JAK) are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine signaling from membrane receptors to STAT transcription factors. Four JAK family members are described in the prior art: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, JAK family members auto- and/or transphosphorylate each other, followed by phosphorylation of STATs and then migrate to the nucleus to modulate transcription. JAK-STAT intracellular signal transduction is suitable for the interferons, most interleukins, as well as a variety of cytokines and endocrine factors such as EPO, TPO, GH, OSM, LIF, CNTF, GM-CSF and PRL (Vainchenker W. et al. (2008)).
",0,EP3305788A1.txt
"The combination of genetic models and small molecule JAK inhibitor research revealed the therapeutic potential of several JAKs. JAK3 is validated by mouse and human genetics as an immune-suppression target (O'Shea J.et al. (2004)). JAK3 inhibitors were successful taken into clinical development, initially for organ transplant rejection but later also in other immuno-inflammatory indications such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and Crohn's diseases (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). TYK2 is a potential target for immuno-inflammatory diseases, being validated by human genetics and mouse knock-out studies (Levy D. and Loomis C.(2007)). JAK1 is a new target in the immuno-inflammatory disease area. JAK1 heterodimerizes with other JAKs to transduce cytokine-driven pro-inflammatory signaling. Therefore, it is expected that inhibition of JAK1 and other JAKs are a therapeutic benefit for a series of inflammatory diseases and other diseases driven by JAK-mediated signal transduction.

"Double helical DNA has two longitudinal spiral grooves running along its exterior, much like the stripes on a barbershop pole. The two grooves are not identical: one, called the major groove, is much wider than the other, called the minor groove.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"The width of the minor groove is approximately equal to the thickness of a benzene ring. Many biologically active DNA-binding molecules-whether synthetic or naturally occurring-are substantially planar polyaromatic molecules having an arcuate footprint, such shape enabling them to fit snugly into the minor groove. For short, a DNA minor groove binding molecule is referred to herein as an MGB, or minor groove binder.

"The biological activity of MGBs derives from their ability to bind to DNA and disrupt its transcription and, in some instances, chemically react with DNA and damage it. Consequently, many MGBs are highly cytotoxic. There is interest in the use of MGBs for the treatment of cancer, as their cytotoxicity can make them effective in killing cancer cells.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"A type of anticancer agent that is generating strong interest is a conjugate, in which a drug is attached to a targeting agent that binds to a ligand on the cancer cell. The targeting agent, by binding to its ligand, directs the drug to the cancer cell, where it is released by one of several mechanisms, to act on the cancer cell.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"A common type of conjugate is an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC,” also referred to as an immunoconjugate). In an ADC, a drug (synonymously therapeutic agent, cytotoxin, payload, or warhead) is covalently linked to an antibody whose antigen is a tumor associated antigen-i.e., an antigen expressed by a cancer cell. MGBs have potential as the drug in an ADC.

"The moiety covalently linking the antibody and the drug is referred to as the linker. Where each antibody has one drug attached to it, the structure of an ADC can be represented generically as:[Antibody]-[Linker]-[Drug]
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"The antibody, upon binding to its antigen, delivers the ADC to the cancer site. There, cleavage of the linker or degradation of the antibody releases the drug. Frequently, the ADC is internalized by endocytosis into the target cell and release of the drug takes place inside it. While the ADC is circulating in the blood, the drug is held inactive because of its linkage to the antibody. Consequently, the drug in an ADC can be much more potent (cytotoxic) than an ordinary chemotherapy agent because its localized release reduces systemic toxicity. For a review on ADCs, see Schrama et al. 2006.

"DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"Definitions
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"“Antibody” means whole antibodies and any antigen binding fragment (i.e., “antigen-binding portion”) or single chain variants thereof. A whole antibody is a protein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (VH) and a heavy chain constant region comprising three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (VL or Vk) and a light chain constant region comprising one single domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with more conserved framework regions (FRs). Each VH and VL comprises three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino- to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The variable regions contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions may mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. An antibody is said to “specifically bind” to an antigen X if the antibody binds to antigen X with a KD of 5×10−8 M or less, more preferably 1×10−8 M or less, more preferably 6×10−9 M or less, more preferably 3×10−9 M or less, even more preferably 2×10−9 M or less. The antibody can be chimeric, humanized, or, preferably, human. The heavy chain constant region can be engineered to affect glycosylation type or extent, to extend antibody half-life, to enhance or reduce interactions with effector cells or the complement system, or to modulate some other property. The engineering can be accomplished by replacement, addition, or deletion of one or more amino acids or by replacement of a domain with a domain from another immunoglobulin type, or a combination of the foregoing.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"“Antigen binding fragment” and “antigen binding portion” of an antibody (or simply “antibody portion” or “antibody fragment”) mean one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody, such as (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fab' fragment, which is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, for example, Abbas et al., Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 6th Ed., Saunders Elsevier 2007); (iv) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (v) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (vi) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; (vii) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR); and (viii) a nanobody, a heavy chain variable region containing a single variable domain and two constant domains. Preferred antigen binding fragments are Fab, F(ab')2, Fab', Fv, and Fd fragments. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are encoded by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv, or scFv); see, e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term “antigen-binding portion” of an antibody.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"An “isolated antibody” means an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds antigen X is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than antigen X). An isolated antibody that specifically binds antigen X may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as antigen X molecules from other species. In certain embodiments, an isolated antibody specifically binds to human antigen X and does not cross-react with other (non-human) antigen X antigens. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.

"“Human antibody” means an antibody having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions (and the constant region, if present) are derived from human germ-line immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies may include later modifications, including natural or synthetic modifications. Human antibodies may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, “human anti-body” does not include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.

"“Human monoclonal antibody” means an antibody displaying a single binding specificity, which has variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma that includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic nonhuman animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.

A similar understanding is applied to the number of carbons in other types, as in C2-4 alkene, C4-C7 cycloaliphatic, etc. In a similar vein, a term such as “(CH2)1-3” is to be understand as shorthand for the subscript being 1, 2, or 3, so that such term represents CH2, CH2CH2, and CH2CH2CH2.

"Compounds disclosed herein can be used as therapeutic agents per se, but preferably are used as the drug component in conjugates. More preferably, the targeting moiety in the conjugate is an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof and its antigen is a tumor associated antigen, i.e., one that is expressed by a cancer cell. Preferably, the tumor associated antigen is uniquely expressed or overexpressed by the cancer cell, compared to a normal cell. The tumor associated antigen can be located on the surface of the cancer cell or secreted by the cancer cell into its environs.

"where Z is a targeting moiety, D is a compound of this invention, and -(XD)aC(XZ)b- are collectively referred to as a “linker moiety” or “linker” because they link Z and D. Within the linker, C is a cleavable group designed to be cleaved at or near the site of intended biological action of D; XD and XZ are spacer moieties (or “spacers”) that space apart D and C and C and Z, respectively; subscripts a, b, and c are independently 0 or 1 (that is, the presence of XD, XZ and C are optional). Subscript m is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (preferably 1, 2, 3, or 4). D, XD, C, XZ and Z are more fully described hereinbelow.

"By binding to a target tissue or cell where its antigen or receptor is located, Z directs the conjugate there. Cleavage of group C at the target tissue or cell releases D to exert its cytotoxic effect locally. In some instances, the conjugate is internalized into a target cell by endocytosis and cleavage takes place within the target cell. In this manner, precise delivery of D is achieved at the site of intended action, reducing the dosage needed. Also, D is normally biologically inactive (or significantly less active) in its conjugated state, thereby reducing undesired toxicity against non-target tissue or cells.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"As reflected by the subscript m, each Z can conjugate with more than one D, depending on the number of sites Z has available for conjugation and the experimental conditions employed. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, while each individual Z is conjugated to an integer number of Ds, a preparation of the conjugate may analyze for a non-integer ratio of D to Z, reflecting a statistical average. This ratio is referred to as the substitution ratio (“SR”) or the drug-antibody ratio (“DAR”).

"Preferably, targeting moiety Z is an antibody. For convenience and brevity and not by way of limitation, the detailed discussion in this specification about Z and its conjugates is written in the context of its being an antibody, but those skilled in the art will understand that other types of Z can be conjugated, mutatis mutandis. For example, conjugates with folic acid as the targeting moiety can target cells having the folate receptor on their surfaces (Leamon et al., Cancer Res. 2008, 68 (23), 9839). For the same reasons, the detailed discussion in this specification is primarily written in terms of a 1:1 ratio of Z to D (m=1).

"A thiol (-SH) group in the side chain of a cysteine can be used to form a conjugate by several methods. It can be used to form a disulfide bond between it and a thiol group on the linker. Another method is via its Michael addition to a maleimide group on the linker.

"Typically, although antibodies have cysteine residues, they lack free thiol groups because all their cysteines are engaged in intra- or inter-chain disulfide bonds. To generate a free thiol group, a native disulfide group can be reduced. See, e.g., Packard et al., Biochemistry 1986, 25, 3548; King et al., Cancer Res. 1994, 54, 6176; and Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnol. 2003, 21, 778. Alternatively, a cysteine having a free -SH group can be introduced by mutating the antibody, substituting a cysteine for another amino acid or inserting one into the polypeptide chain.

"As noted above, the linker comprises up to three elements: a cleavable group C and optional spacers XZ and XD.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"Group C is cleavable under physiological conditions. Preferably it is relatively stable while the conjugate is in circulation in the blood, but is readily cleaved once the conjugate reaches its site of intended action, near, at, or within the target cell. Preferably, the conjugate is internalized by a target cell upon binding of an antibody Z to an antigen displayed on the surface of the target cell. Subsequently, cleavage of C occurs in a vesicular body of the target cell (an early endosome, a late endosome, or, especially, a lysosome).
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"In one embodiment, C is a pH sensitive group. The pH in blood plasma is slightly above neutral, while the pH inside a lysosome is acidic, circa 5. Thus, an acid-sensitive C will cleave at a rate several orders of magnitude faster inside a lysosome than in blood. Examples of acid-sensitive groups are cis-aconityl amides and hydrazones, as described in Shen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,190 (1986); Shen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,144,011 (1992); Shen et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981, 102, 1048; and Yang et al., Proc. Natl Acad.

"In another embodiment, C is a disulfide. Disulfides can be cleaved by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism, at a rate dependent on the ambient thiol concentration. As the intracellular concentration of glutathione and other thiols is higher than their serum concentrations, the cleavage rate of a disulfide will be higher intracellularly. Further, the rate of thiol-disulfide exchange can be modulated by adjustment of the steric and electronic characteristics of the disulfide (e.g., an alkyl-aryl disulfide versus an alkyl-alkyl disulfide; substitution on the aryl ring, etc.), enabling the design of disulfide linkages that have enhanced serum stability or a particular cleavage rate. See, e.g., Thorpe et al., Cancer Res. 2008, 48, 6396-6403; Santi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,541,530 B2 (2009); Ng et al., U.S. Pat.

"A preferred group C is a peptide that is cleaved selectively by a protease inside the target cell, as opposed to by a protease in the serum. Typically, the peptide comprises from 1 to 20 amino acids, preferably from 1 to 6 amino acids, more preferably from 2 to 3 amino acids. The amino acid(s) can be natural and/or non-natural α-amino acids. Natural amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as amino acids derived therefrom, e.g., hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, citrulline, and O-phosphoserine. In this specification, the term “amino acid” also includes amino acid analogs and mimetics. Analogs are compounds having the same general H2N(R)CHCO2H structure of a natural amino acid, except that the R group is not one found among the natural amino acids. Examples of analogs include homoserine, norleucine, methionine-sulfoxide, and methionine methyl sulfonium. An amino acid mimetic is a compound that has a structure different from the general chemical structure of an α-amino acid but functions in a manner similar to one. The amino acid can be of the “L” stereochemistry of the genetically encoded amino acids, as well as of the enantiomeric “D” stereochemistry.

Also, a PEG group may enhance the solubility or reduce aggregation in the resulting ADC. Where a PEG group is present, it may be incorporated into either spacer XZ of XD, or both.

"Either spacer XZ or XD, or both, can comprise a self-immolating moiety. A self-immolating moiety is a moiety that (1) is bonded to C and either Z or D and (2) has a structure such that cleavage from group C initiates a reaction sequence resulting in the self-immolating moiety disbonding itself from Z or D, as the case may be. In other words, reaction at a site distal from Z or D (cleavage from group C) causes the XZ-Z or the XD-D bond to rupture as well. The presence of a self-immolating moiety is desirable in the case of spacer XD because, if, after cleavage of the conjugate, spacer XD or a portion thereof were to remain attached to D, the biological activity of D may be impaired. The use of a self-immolating moiety is especially desirable where cleavable group C is a polypeptide, in which instance the self-immolating moiety typically is located adjacent thereto, in order to prevent D from sterically or electronically interfering with peptide cleavage.

"Yet another conjugation technique involves introducing a non-natural amino acid into an antibody, with the non-natural amino acid providing a functionality for conjugation with a reactive functional group in the drug moiety. For instance, the non-natural amino acid p-acetylphenylalanine can be incorporated into an antibody or other polypeptide, as taught in Tian et al., WO 2008/030612 A2 (2008). The ketone group in p-acetylphenyalanine can be a conjugation site via the formation of an oxime with a hydroxylamino group on the linker-drug moiety. Alternatively, the non-natural amino acid p-azidophenylalanine can be incorporated into an antibody to provide an azide functional group for conjugation via click chemistry, as discussed above. Non-natural amino acids can also be incorporated into an antibody or other polypeptide using cell-free methods, as taught in Goerke et al., US 2010/0093024 A1 (2010) and Goerke et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009, 102 (2), 400-416. The foregoing disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. Thus, in one embodiment, an antibody that is used for making a conjugate has one or more amino acids replaced by a non-natural amino acid, which preferably is p-acetylphenylalanine or p-azidophenylalanine, more preferably p-acetylphenylalanine.

"Still another conjugation technique uses the enzyme transglutaminase (preferably bacterial transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis or BTG), per Jeger et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2010, 49, 9995. BTG forms an amide bond between the side chain carboxamide of a glutamine (the amine acceptor) and an alkyleneamino group (the amine donor), which can be, for example, the ε-amino group of a lysine or a 5-amino-n-pentyl group. In a typical conjugation reaction, the glutamine residue is located on the antibody, while the alkyleneamino group is located on the linker-drug moiety, as shown below:

"The positioning of a glutamine residue on a polypeptide chain has a large effect on its susceptibility to BTG mediated transamidation. None of the glutamine residues on an antibody are normally BTG substrates. However, if the antibody is deglycosylated-the glycosylation site being asparagine 297 (N297; numbering per EU index as set forth in Kabat et al., “Sequences of proteins of immunological interest,” 5th ed., Pub. No. 91-3242, U.S. Dept. Health & Human Services, NIH, Bethesda, Md., 1991; hereinafter “Kabat”) of the heavy chain-nearby glutamine 295 (Q295) is rendered BTG susceptible. An antibody can be deglycosylated enzymatically by treatment with PNGase F (Peptide-N-Glycosidase F). Alternatively, an antibody can be synthesized glycoside free by introducing an N297A mutation in the constant region, to eliminate the N297 glycosylation site. Further, it has been shown that an N297Q substitution not only eliminates glycosylation, but also introduces a second glutamine residue (at position 297) that too is an amine acceptor. Thus, in one embodiment, the antibody is deglycosylated. In another embodiment, the antibody has an N297Q substitution. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that deglycosylation by post-synthesis modification or by introducing an N297A mutation generates two BTG-reactive glutamine residues per antibody (one per heavy chain, at position 295), while an antibody with an N297Q substitution will have four BTG-reactive glutamine residues (two per heavy chain, at positions 295 and 297).
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"An antibody can also be rendered susceptible to BTG-mediated conjugation by introducing into it a glutamine containing peptide, or “tag,” as taught, for example, in Pons et al., US 2013/0230543 A1 (2013) and Rao-Naik et al., WO 2016/144608 A1.

"While the most commonly available bacterial transglutaminase is that from S. mobaraensis, transglutaminase from other bacteria, having somewhat different substrate specificities, can be considered, such as transglutaminase from Streptoverticillium ladakanum (Hu et al., US 2009/0318349 A1 (2009), US 2010/0099610 A1 (2010), and US 2010/0087371 A1 (2010)).

"Example 1-Conjugation by Michael Addition
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"This general procedure is based on introduction of free thiol groups into an antibody by reaction of lysine ε-amino groups with 2-iminothiolane, followed by reaction with a maleimide-containing drug-linker moiety, such as described above. Initially the antibody is buffer exchanged into 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTPA and concentrated to 5-10 mg/mL. Thiolation is achieved through addition of 2-imino-thiolane to the antibody. The amount of 2-iminothiolane to be added can be determined by a preliminary experiment and varies from antibody to antibody. In the preliminary experiment, a titration of increasing amounts of 2-iminothiolane is added to the antibody, and following incubation with the antibody for 1 h at room temperature (“RT,” circa 25° C.), the antibody is desalted into 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM Glycine, 2 mM DTPA, pH 5.5 using a SEPHADEX™ G-25 column and the number of thiol groups introduced determined rapidly by reaction with DTDP. Reaction of thiol groups with DTDP results in liberation of thiopyridine, which can be monitored spectroscopically at 324 nm. Samples at a protein concentration of 0.5-1.0 mg/mL are typically used. The absorbance at 280 nm can be used to accurately determine the concentration of protein in the samples, and then an aliquot of each sample (0.9 mL) is incubated with 0.1 mL DTDP (5 mM stock solution in ethanol) for 10 min at RT. Blank samples of buffer alone plus DTDP are also incubated alongside. After 10 min, absorbance at 324 nm is measured and the number of thiol groups is quantitated using an extinction coefficient for thiopyridine of 19,800 M−1.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"Typically a thiolation level of about two to three thiol groups per antibody is desirable. For example, with some antibodies this can be achieved by adding a 15-fold molar excess of 2-iminothiolane followed by incubation at RT for 1 h. The antibody is then incubated with 2-iminothiolane at the desired molar ratio and then desalted into conjugation buffer (50 mM HEPES, 5 mM glycine, 2 mM DTPA, pH 5.5)). The thiolated material is maintained on ice while the number of thiols introduced is quantitated as described above.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"After verification of the number of thiols introduced, the drug-linker moiety is added at a 2.5-fold molar excess per thiol. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed in conjugation buffer containing a final concentration of 25% propylene glycol and 5% trehalose. Commonly, the drug-linker stock solution is dissolved in 100% DMSO. The stock solution is added directly to the thiolated antibody.
",0,US20180110873A1.txt
"The conjugation reaction mixture is incubated at RT for 2 h with gentle stirring. A 10-fold molar excess of N-ethyl maleimide (100 mM Stock in DMSO) is then added to the conjugation mixture and stirred for an additional hour to block any unreacted thiols. The sample is then filtered via a 0.2μ filter The material is buffer exchanged via TFF VivaFlow 50 Sartorius 30 MWCO PES membrane into 10 mg/mL glycine, 20 mg/mL sorbitol, 15% acetonitrile, pH 5.0 (5×TFF buffer exchange volume), to remove any unreacted drug.

The antibody can be one that has a transglutaminase-reactive glutamine, for example one with an N297A or N297Q substitution. Conjugation is carried out by recombinant bacterial transglutaminase with a molar ratio of antibody:enzyme of 5:1. The conjugation is carried out using standard protocols in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, incubated overnight at 37° C. The resulting conjugate is purified on a Protein A column, pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The conjugate is eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.5. The eluted fractions are neutralized with 1M Tris pH 9.0. The conjugated can be formulated in 20 mg/mL Sorbitol, 10 mg/mL Glycine, pH 5.0.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,US20180016260A1.txt
"The immune system plays an important role in controlling and eradicating diseases such as cancer. However, cancer cells often develop strategies to evade or to suppress the immune system in order to favor their growth. One such mechanism is altering the expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules expressed on immune cells (Postow et al, J. Clinical Oncology 2015, 1-9). Blocking the signaling of an inhibitory immune checkpoint, such as PD-1, has proven to be a promising and effective treatment modality.

"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), also known as CD279, is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells, natural killer T cells, B cells, and macrophages (Greenwald et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol 2005, 23:515-548; Okazaki and Honjo, Trends Immunol 2006, (4): 195-201). It functions as an intrinsic negative feedback system to prevent the activation of T-cells, which in turn reduces autoimmunity and promotes self-tolerance. In addition, PD-1 is also known to play a critical role in the suppression of antigen-specific T cell response in diseases like cancer and viral infection (Sharpe et al, Nat Immunol 2007 8, 239-245; Postow et al, J. Clinical Oncol 2015, 1-9).

"The structure of PD-1 consists of an extracellular immunoglobulin variable-like domain followed by a transmembrane region and an intracellular domain (Parry et al, Mol Cell Biol 2005, 9543-9553). The intracellular domain contains two phosphorylation sites located in an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif, which suggests that PD-1 negatively regulates T cell receptor-mediated signals. PD-1 has two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 (Parry et al, Mol Cell Biol 2005, 9543-9553; Latchman et al, Nat Immunol 2001, 2, 261-268), and they differ in their expression patterns. PD-L1 protein is upregulated on macrophages and dendritic cells in response to lipopolysaccharide and GM-CSF treatment, and on T cells and B cells upon T cell receptor and B cell receptor signaling. PD-L1 is also highly expressed on almost all tumor cells, and the expression is further increased after IFN-γ treatment (Iwai et al, PNAS2002, 99(19):12293-7; Blank et al, Cancer Res 2004, 64(3):1140-5). In fact, tumor PD-L1 expression status has been shown to be prognostic in multiple tumor types (Wang et al, Eur J Surg Oncol 2015; Huang et al, Oncol Rep 2015; Sabatier et al, Oncotarget 2015, 6(7): 5449-5464). PD-L2 expression, in contrast, is more restricted and is expressed mainly by dendritic cells (Nakae et al, J Immunol 2006, 177:566-73). Ligation of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on T cells delivers a signal that inhibits IL-2 and IFN-γ production, as well as cell proliferation induced upon T cell receptor activation (Carter et al, Eur J Immunol 2002, 32(3):634-43; Freeman et al, J Exp Med 2000, 192(7): 1027-34). The mechanism involves recruitment of SHP-2 or SHP-1 phosphatases to inhibit T cell receptor signaling such as Syk and Lck phosphorylation (Sharpe et al, Nat Immunol 2007, 8, 239-245). Activation of the PD-1 signaling axis also attenuates PKC-θ activation loop phosphorylation, which is necessary for the activation of NF-κB and API pathways, and for cytokine production such as IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF (Sharpe et al, Nat Immunol 2007, 8, 239-245; Carter et al, Eur J Immunol 2002, 32(3):634-43; Freeman et al, J Exp Med 2000, 192(7):1027-34).

"Several lines of evidence from preclinical animal studies indicate that PD-1 and its ligands negatively regulate immune responses. PD-1-deficient mice have been shown to develop lupus-like glomerulonephritis and dilated cardiomyopathy (Nishimura et al, Immunity 1999, 11:141-151; Nishimura et al, Science 2001, 291:319-322). Using an LCMV model of chronic infection, it has been shown that PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibits activation, expansion and acquisition of effector functions of virus-specific CD8 T cells (Barber et al, Nature 2006, 439, 682-7). Together, these data support the development of a therapeutic approach to block the PD-1-mediated inhibitory signaling cascade in order to augment or “rescue” T cell response. Accordingly, there is a need for new compounds that block PD-1/PD-L1 protein/protein interaction.

"Specifically, a labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to identify and/or evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a PD-L1 protein by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the PD-L1 protein, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to a PD-L1 protein (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the PD-L1 protein directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.

"The present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device comprising the same.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"BACKGROUND ART
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"In general, the term “organic light-emitting phenomenon” refers to a phenomenon in which electrical energy is converted to light energy by means of an organic material.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"An organic light-emitting device using the organic light-emitting phenomenon has a structure usually including an anode, a cathode, and an organic material layer interposed therebetween. In this regard, the organic material layer may have, for the most part, a multilayer structure consisting of different materials, for example, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer. In the organic light-emitting device having such a structure, application of a voltage between the two electrodes injects a hole from the anode and an electron from the cathode to the organic layer. In the luminescent zone, the hole and the electron recombine to produce an exciton. When the exciton returns to the ground state from the excited state, the molecule of the organic layer emits light. Such an organic light-emitting device is known to have characteristics such as self-luminescence, high luminance, high efficiency, low driving voltage, a wide viewing angle, high contrast, and high-speed response.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"The materials used as organic layers in organic light-emitting devices may be divided into luminescent materials and charge-carrying materials, for example, a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an electron injection material, and an electron transport material. As for the luminescent materials, there are two main families according to molecular weight: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. The light-emitting mechanism forms the basis for classification of the luminescent materials as fluorescent or phosphorescent materials, which use excitons in singlet and triplet states, respectively. Further, luminescent materials may be divided according to color into blue, green, and red light-emitting materials. Further, yellow and reddish yellow light-emitting materials have been developed in order to achieve more natural colors.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"Meanwhile, when a single material is employed as the luminescent material, intermolecular actions cause the wavelength of maximum luminescence to shift toward a longer wavelength, resulting in reduced color purity and light emission efficiency due to the light attenuation. In this regard, a host-dopant system may be used as a luminescent material so as to increase the color purity and the light emission efficiency through energy transfer.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"This is based on the principle whereby, when a dopant is smaller in energy band gap than a host accounting for the light-emitting layer, the addition of a small amount of the dopant to the host generates excitons from the light-emitting layer so that the excitons are transported to the dopant, emitting light at high efficiency. Here, light of desired wavelengths can be obtained depending on the kind of dopant because the wavelength of the host moves to the wavelength range of the dopant.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"In order for organic light-emitting devices to sufficiently exhibit the aforementioned outstanding properties, materials accounting for organic layers in the devices, for example, hole injection materials, hole transport materials, light-emitting materials, electron transport materials, electron injection materials, etc., should be based on stable and effective materials in advance.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"Application of an electric current to such an organic light-emitting device induces the injection of holes and electrons from the anode and the cathode, respectively. After being transported respectively by a hole transport layer and an electron transport layer, the injected holes and electrons recombine in a light-emitting layer to produce excitons. The excitons return to the ground state, emitting light. According to the light-emitting mechanism, the light is classified as fluorescence emission with singlet transition to singlet and phosphorescence emission with triplet transition singlet. The fluorescence and the phosphorescence may be used as luminescent light sources of organic light-emitting devices.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"In fluorescent organic light-emitting devices, only the formation of singlet excitons results in the emission of useful radiation, and thus there is a theoretical limit of 25% in the internal quantum efficiency of fluorescent organic light-emitting devices. On the other hand, phosphorescent light, which uses triplet excitons, has been extensively studied because its emission efficiency is far superior to that of fluorescent light.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"So far, the most widely known phosphorescent host material is CBP, and organic light-emitting devices employing a hole barrier layer of BCP, BAlq, etc. are also known.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"However, although devices employing phosphorescent materials are higher in terms of efficiency than those employing fluorescent materials, conventional phosphorescent host materials, such as BAlq or CBP, have room for improvement because they require high driving voltages and are unsatisfactory in terms of lifespan.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"With regard to related arts pertaining to such phosphorescent materials for use in light-emitting devices, reference may be made to Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2011-0013220 A (Feb. 9, 2011), which discloses an organic compound having a 6-membered aromatic or heteroaromatic ring frame grafted with an aromatic heterocyclic ring, and Japanese Patent Publication No. 2010-166070 A (Jul. 29, 2010), which discloses an organic compound having a substituted or unsubstituted pyrimidine or quinazoline frame grafted with an aryl or heteroaryl ring.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"Despite enormous efforts to prepare luminescent materials for use in organic light-emitting devices or electron transport materials, there is still a continued need to develop organic light-emitting devices that exhibit higher light emission efficiency and which can be driven at low voltages.

",0,US20180051018A1.txt
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a generic term for diseases that have been conventionally called chronic bronchitis or emphysema. COPD is a chronic disease of the lungs, which is caused by long-term inhalation exposure of harmful substances mainly containing tobacco smoke, and is said to be a lifestyle-related disease that occurs in middle-aged or older people against the background of smoking habit.
",0,US20180051018A1.txt
"In the drug therapy for COPD, a bronchodilator (an anticholinergic drug, a β2-agonist, or a theophylline drug) is mainly used, and an inhaled anticholinergic drug or an inhaled β2-agonist that mainly dilates the bronchi for a long time is used. In addition, an inhaled corticosteroid is used in severe cases.

"In recent years, as a drug effective for the treatment of COPD, for example, a quinuclidine derivative as a muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist (Patent Literature 1), N-phenylbenzamide having a bronchodilation effect (Patent Literature 2), and a substance that inhibits the production or accumulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans as an emphysema inhibitor (Patent Literature 3), have been reported.

"However, although the quinuclidine derivative and the N-phenylbenzamide have some degree of the long-term bronchodilation effect, it cannot be said at present that they have a sufficient therapeutic effect on COPD.

"Solution to Problem
",0,US20180051018A1.txt
"Therefore, the present inventors have studied to develop a novel therapeutic drug for COPD, and have extensively studied based on the findings that a drug having only the long-term bronchodilation effect is not sufficient as the therapeutic drug for COPD, and a drug having a suppressive effect on chronic inflammation of the lungs together with the long-term bronchodilation effect is useful for COPD. As a result, the present inventors have found that a compound represented by the following general formula (1) has a long-term bronchodilation effect lasting longer than that of the compound described in Patent Literature 1, and further suppresses inflammation of the lungs, therefore, is particularly useful as a therapeutic drug for COPD; and thus have completed the present invention.

",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"P2Y receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are selectively activated by naturally occurring extracellular nucleotides, including, for example, adenine and pyrimidine nucleotides. There are two clusters of P2Y receptors: the Gq-coupled P2Y1-like receptors, including P2Y1,2,4,6,11 subtypes; and the Gi-coupled P2Y12-like receptors, including P2Y12, 13, 14 subtypes. Of the four P2Y receptors, i.e., P2Y2, 4, 6, 14 subtypes, which can be activated by pyrimidine nucleotides, the P2Y2 and P2Y4 subtypes are activated by uridine triphosphate (UTP), P2Y6 receptor is activated by uridine diphosphate (UDP), and P2Y14 is activated by UDP or UDP-glucose.

"The P2Y6 receptor has been implicated in a number of disorders, including, for example, neurodegeneration, osteoporosis, ischemic effect in skeletal muscle, and diabetes. It has been reported that agonists of P2Y6 receptor counteract apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α in astrocytoma cells and induce protection in a model of ischemic hindleg skeletal muscle. P2Y6 receptor was also reported to play a role in phagocytosis in microglial cells when activated by its endogenous agonist UDP. See, e.g., Malmsjo et al. BMC Pharmacol. 2003, 3, 4; Balasubramanian et al. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010, 79, 1317-1332; Kim et al. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2003, 23, 401-418; Mamedova et al. Pharmacol. Res. 2008, 58, 232-239; Korcok et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2005, 58, 232-239; and Koizumi et al. Nature, 2007, 446, 1091-1095. These reports suggest that ligands of the P2Y6 receptor are of interest in the search for new treatments for P2Y6 receptor-related conditions.

"“Treating” a condition or patient refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation, amelioration, or slowing the progression, of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder, for example, a neuronal disorder, including neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury, as well as pain. In certain embodiments, treatment may be prophylactic. Exemplary beneficial clinical results are described herein.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"“Administering” or “administration of” a substance, a compound or an agent to a subject can be carried out using one of a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, a compound or an agent can be administered, intravenously, arterially, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, ocularly, sublingually, orally (by ingestion), intranasally (by inhalation), intraspinally, intracerebrally, and transdermally (by absorption, e.g., through a skin duct). A compound or agent can also appropriately be introduced by rechargeable or biodegradable polymeric devices or other devices, e.g., patches and pumps, or formulations, which provide for the extended, slow or controlled release of the compound or agent. Administering can also be performed, for example, once, a plurality of times, and/or over one or more extended periods. In some aspects, the administration includes both direct administration, including self-administration, and indirect administration, including the act of prescribing a drug. For example, as used herein, a physician who instructs a patient to self-administer a drug, or to have the drug administered by another and/or who provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug to the patient.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"Appropriate methods of administering a substance, a compound or an agent to a subject will also depend, for example, on the age of the subject, whether the subject is active or inactive at the time of administering, whether the subject is cognitively impaired at the time of administering, the extent of the impairment, and the chemical and biological properties of the compound or agent (e.g. solubility, digestibility, bioavailability, stability, toxicity, and metabolic profile). In some embodiments, a compound or an agent is administered orally, e.g., to a subject by ingestion. In some embodiments, the orally administered compound or agent is in an extended release or slow release formulation, or administered using a device for such slow or extended release.

"A “therapeutically effective amount” or a “therapeutically effective dose” of a drug or agent is an amount of a drug or an agent that, when administered to a subject will have the intended therapeutic effect. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. The precise effective amount needed for a subject will depend upon, for example, the subject's size, health and age, the nature and extent of cognitive impairment or other symptoms of the condition being treated, such as neurodegeneration (such as Alzheimer's disease), pain and traumatic brain injury, the therapeutics or combination of therapeutics selected for administration, and the mode of administration. The skilled worker can readily determine the effective amount for a given situation by routine experimentation.

Many of these, as well as other conditions described herein, are characterized by a level of cognitive impairment and/or some decrease or loss of cognitive function. Cognitive function and cognitive impairment are used as understood in the art. For example, cognitive function generally refers to the mental processes by which one becomes aware of, perceives, or comprehends ideas. Cognitive function involves all aspects of perception, thinking, learning, reasoning, memory, awareness, and capacity for judgment. Cognitive impairment generally refers to conditions or symptoms involving problems with thought processes. This may manifest itself in one or more symptoms indicating a decrease in cognitive function, such as impairment or decrease of higher reasoning skills, forgetfulness, impairments to memory, learning disabilities, concentration difficulties, decreased intelligence, and other reductions in mental functions.

"Neurodegenerative disease typically involves reductions in the mass and volume of the human brain, which may be due to the atrophy and/or death of brain cells, which are far more profound than those in a healthy person that are attributable to aging. Neurodegenerative diseases can evolve gradually, after a long period of normal brain function, due to progressive degeneration (e.g., nerve cell dysfunction and death) of specific brain regions. Alternatively, neurodegenerative diseases can have a quick onset, such as those associated with trauma or toxins. The actual onset of brain degeneration may precede clinical expression by many years. Examples of neurodegenerative diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease), diffuse Lewy body disease, chorea-acanthocytosis, primary lateral sclerosis, ocular diseases (ocular neuritis), chemotherapy-induced neuropathies (e.g., from vincristine, paclitaxel, bortezomib), diabetes-induced neuropathies and Friedreich's ataxia. P2Y6 receptor-modulating compounds of the present disclosure can be used to treat these disorders and others as described below.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"AD is a CNS disorder that results in memory loss, unusual behavior, personality changes, and a decline in thinking abilities. These losses are related to the death of specific types of brain cells and the breakdown of connections and their supporting network (e.g. glial cells) between them. The earliest symptoms include loss of recent memory, faulty judgment, and changes in personality. Without being bound by theory, these changes in the brain and symptoms associated with cognitive impairment, including memory and learning impairment, are caused, in whole or in part, by accumulation of beta amyloid and the resulting deposition of amyloid plaques. PD is a CNS disorder that results in uncontrolled body movements, rigidity, tremor, and dyskinesia, and is associated with the death of brain cells in an area of the brain that produces dopamine. ALS (motor neuron disease) is a CNS disorder that attacks the motor neurons, components of the CNS that connect the brain to the skeletal muscles.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"HD is another neurodegenerative disease that causes uncontrolled movements, loss of intellectual faculties, and emotional disturbance. Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease are glycolipid storage diseases where GM2 ganglioside and related glycolipids substrates for β-hexosaminidase accumulate in the nervous system and trigger acute neurodegeneration.

"In a particular embodiment, the disclosure provides methods for doing one or more of decreasing plaque burden, improving cognitive function, decreasing or delaying cognitive impairment, or improving hippocampal long term potentiation by administering to a subject in need thereof a compound of the disclosure. These methods may also be used for one or more of enhancing beta amyloid clearance, increasing synaptic plasticity, or improving or restoring memory. The foregoing are exemplary of beneficial results that would help alleviate (e.g., treat) one or more symptoms of conditions associated with cognitive impairment. Exemplary conditions include AD, traumatic brain injury, and Down Syndrome, as well as other neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the disclosure contemplates the alleviation of symptoms in conditions and scenarios associated with milder forms of cognitive impairment, such as age-related dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and even to improve memory and cognitive function that typically declines, even in relatively healthy individuals, as part of the normal aging process. Exemplary such agonists are described herein, and the disclosure contemplates that any such compounds can be used in the treatment of any of the conditions described herein. Regardless of whether one of the agonists described herein are used or whether another agonist is used, the disclosure contemplates that the agonist may be formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and administered by any suitable route of administration. These methods are of particular use when the subject in need thereof has Alzheimer's disease. It is understood by those of skill in the art that definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is difficult and may require postmortem examination. Thus, in this context and in the context of the present disclosure, having Alzheimer's disease is used to refer to subjects who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or who are suspected by a physician of having Alzheimer's disease. However, these methods are also of particular use when the subject in need thereof has any other condition associated with cognitive impairment, for example, a condition in which the impairment is accompanied with an increase in beta amyloid, a decrease in the rate of beta amyloid clearance, and/or an increase in amyloid plaque deposition.

"Cognitive function and cognitive impairment may be readily evaluated using tests well known in the art. Performance in these tests can be compared over time to determine whether a treated subject is improving or whether further decline has stopped or slowed, relative to the previous rate of decline of that patient or compared to an average rate of decline. Exemplary tests used in animal studies are provided in, for example, Animal Models of Cognitive Impairment, Levin E D, Buccafusco J J, editors. Boca Raton (Fla.): CRC Press; 2006. Tests of cognitive function, including memory and learning for evaluating human patients are well known in the art and regularly used to evaluate and monitor subjects having or suspected of having cognitive disorders such as AD. Even in healthy individuals, these and other standard tests of cognitive function can be readily used to evaluate beneficial affects over time.

"In certain aspects, the compounds as described herein can be used to treat patients having pain. Pain is a complex physiological process that involves a number of sensory and neural mechanisms. Compounds to be used according to the present disclosure are suitable for administration to a subject for treatment (including prevention and/or alleviation) of chronic and/or acute pain, in particular non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain such as back pain, fibromyalgia and myofascial pain, more particularly for reduction of the associated muscular hyperalgesia or muscular allodynia. Nonlimiting examples of types of pain that can be treated by the compounds, compositions and methods of the present disclosure include chronic conditions such as musculoskeletal pain, including fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, back pain, pain during menstruation, pain during osteoarthritis, pain during rheumatoid arthritis, pain during gastrointestinal inflammation, pain during inflammation of the heart muscle, pain during multiple sclerosis, pain during neuritis, pain during AIDS, pain during chemotherapy, tumor pain, headache, CPS (chronic pain syndrome), central pain, neuropathic pain such as trigeminal neuralgia, shingles, stamp pain, phantom limb pain, temporomandibular joint disorder, nerve injury, migraine, post-herpetic neuralgia, neuropathic pain encountered as a consequence of injuries, amputation infections, metabolic disorders or degenerative diseases of the nervous system, neuropathic pain associated with diabetes, pseudesthesia, hypothyroidism, uremia, vitamin deficiency or alcoholism; and acute pain such as pain after injuries, postoperative pain, pain during acute gout or pain during operations, such as jaw surgery.

"Somatogenic pain may be of nociceptive, inflammatory or neuropathic origin. Nociceptive pain is related to activation of somatic or visceral pain-sensitive nerve fibers, typically by physical or chemical injury to tissues. Inflammatory pain results from inflammation, for example an inflammatory response of living tissues to any stimulus including injury, infection or irritation. Neuropathic pain results from dysfunction in the nervous system. Neuropathic pain is believed to be sustained by aberrant somatosensory mechanisms in the peripheral nervous system, the central nervous system (CNS), or both. According to one aspect of the disclosure, somatogenic pain may be treated by compounds as described herein.

"Non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain is a particular form of chronic pain that is generally not traced to a specific structural or inflammatory cause and that generally does not appear to be induced by tissue damage and macrophage infiltration (resulting in edema) as occurs in a classical immune system response. Although non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain is believed to result from peripheral and/or central sensitization, the cause is not presently fully understood. It is often associated with physical or mental stress, lack of adequate or restful sleep, or exposure to cold or damp. Non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain is also believed to be associated with or precipitated by systemic disorders such as viral or other infections. Examples of non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain include neck and shoulder pain and spasms, low back pain, and achy chest or thigh muscles, which may be treated by a compound of the present disclosure. Non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain may be generalized or localized.

"According to a further aspect of the disclosure, a compound as described herein may be administered to a subject to treat fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). FMS and MPS are medical conditions characterized by fibromyalgia and myofascial pain respectively, which are two types of non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain. FMS is a complex syndrome associated with significant impairment of quality of life and can result in substantial financial costs. Fibromyalgia is a systemic process that typically causes tender points (local tender areas in normal-appearing tissues) in particular areas of the body and is frequently associated with a poor sleep pattern and/or stressful environment. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia is typically based on a history of widespread pain (e.g., bilateral, upper and lower body, and/or spinal pain), and presence of excessive tenderness on applying pressure to a number of (sometimes more precisely defined as at least 11 out of 18) specific muscle-tender sites. FMS is typically a chronic syndrome that causes pain and stiffness throughout the tissues that support and move the bones and joints. Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a chronic non-degenerative, non-inflammatory musculoskeletal condition often associated with spasm or pain in the masticatory muscles. Distinct areas within muscles or their delicate connective tissue coverings (fascia) become abnormally thickened or tight. When the myofascial tissues tighten and lose their elasticity, the ability of neurotransmitters to send and receive messages between the brain and body is disrupted. Specific discrete areas of muscle may be tender when firm fingertip pressure is applied; these areas are called tender or trigger points. Symptoms of MPS include muscle stiffness and aching and sharp shooting pains or tingling and numbness in areas distant from a trigger point. The discomfort may cause sleep disturbance, fatigue and depression. Most commonly trigger points are in the jaw (temporomandibular) region, neck, back or buttocks. Myofascial pain differs from fibromyalgia: MPS and FMS are two separate entities, each having its own pathology, but sharing the muscle as a common pathway of pain. Myofascial pain is typically a more localized or regional (along the muscle and surrounding fascia tissues) pain process that is often associated with trigger point tenderness. Myofascial pain can be treated by a variety of methods (sometimes in combination) including stretching, ultrasound, ice sprays with stretching, exercises, and injections of anesthetic.

"A further non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain condition is back pain, notably low back pain, which may also be treated with a compound of the present disclosure. This condition may also be treating by administering a compound of the present disclosure to a subject in need thereof. Back pain is a common musculoskeletal symptom that may be either acute or chronic. It may be caused by a variety of diseases and disorders that affect the lumbar spine. Low back pain is often accompanied by sciatica, which is pain that involves the sciatic nerve and is felt in the lower back, the buttocks, and the backs of the thighs.

"Glaucoma refers to a group of eye conditions that lead to damage to the optic nerve. This nerve carries visual information from the eye to the brain. In most cases, damage to the optic nerve is due to increased pressure in the eye, also known as intraocular pressure (IOP). Over time, the elevated intraocular pressure and optic nerve damage leads to visual field loss, and may result in blindness. Ocular hypertension is intraocular pressure higher than normal in the absence of optic nerve damage or visual field loss. Currently, ophthalmologists generally define normal intraocular pressure as from 10 mmHg and 21 mmHg, and intraocular pressure above 21 mmHg is considered ocular hypertension or elevated intraocular pressure. Ocular hypertension is considered a significant risk factor for developing glaucoma, and thus, patients with ocular hypertension should be closely monitored for glaucoma.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"Glaucoma is the second-most common cause of blindness in the United States. The nerve damage involves loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern. The many different subtypes of glaucoma can all be considered to be a type of optic neuropathy. Raised intraocular pressure (above 21 mmHg or 2.8 kPa) is the most important and only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. However, some patients may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage, while others can develop nerve damage at a relatively low pressure. Untreated glaucoma can lead to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which over time can progress to blindness.

"The two main types of glaucoma, each of which are marked by elevated intraocular pressure, are open-angle and angle-closure. Open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma also include the following variants: (i) secondary glaucoma; (ii) pigmentary glaucoma; (iii) pseudoexfoliative glaucoma; (iv) traumatic glaucoma; (v) neovascular glaucoma; and (vi) irido corneal endothelial syndrome (ICE).
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"Open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of glaucoma, accounts for at least 90% of all glaucoma cases. Open-angle glaucoma is also called primary or chronic glaucoma and generally has the following characteristics: (i) caused by the slow clogging of the drainage canals, resulting in increased eye pressure; (ii) has a wide and open angle between the iris and cornea; and (iii) develops slowly and is a lifelong condition. Angle-closure glaucoma, a less common form of glaucoma, is also called acute glaucoma or narrow-angle glaucoma. Unlike open-angle glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma is a result of the angle between the iris and cornea closing, and angle-closure glaucoma generally has the following characteristics: (i) caused by blocked drainage canals, resulting in a sudden rise in intraocular pressure; (ii) has a closed or narrow angle between the iris and cornea; (iii) develops very quickly; and (iv) demands immediate medical attention.

"In open-angle glaucoma, there are actually few overt symptoms. Patients have elevated intraocular pressure or, at least, periods of elevated intraocular pressure. However, the intraocular pressure slowly damages the optic nerve, and thus, vision loss is slow and not typically accompanied by pain. In fact, noticeable vision loss, which typically manifests as slow loss of peripheral vision leading to tunnel vision, is a symptom of relatively advanced and severe disease. Ultimately, open-angle glaucoma can lead to blindness.

Exemplary tests that can be used, alone or in combination, include tonometry, gonioscopy, optic nerve imaging, slit lamp examination, examination of the retina, visual acuity measurements, and visual field measurements. These tests can also be used to monitor a patient after initiation of treatment. For example, these tests can be used to determine whether treatment has slowed or stopped the progress of the disease, has decreased elevated intraocular pressure (e.g., restored normal intraocular pressure), and whether the patient's vision has improved or ceased further deterioration.

Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., mouth to anus), leading to diverse GI symptoms. Approximately 50% of cases affect both ileum and the large intestines. The primary symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomitting, and/or weight loss. In addition, patients may experience symptoms and complications in other tissues and organs, such as anemia, skin rash, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. In some cases, uncontrolled disease may lead to obstruction, fistula, or abscess. Ulcerative colitis affects the colon and is characterized by ulcers or open sores. The main symptom of active disease includes constant diarrhea mixed with blood and/or mucus. The frequency and severity of the diarrhea varies with the severity of the disease, and the GI-tract bleeding may lead to anemia. Like with Crohn's disease, non-GI symptoms may also be present. Severe ulcerative colitis can lead to perforation and may be fatal. Numerous animal models to, for example, study inflammatory bowel disease and/or optimize treatment are available.

Endometriosis is a gynecological condition in which cells from the lining of the uterus (endometrium) appear and flourish outside the uterine cavity, most commonly on the membrane which lines the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum. Symptoms of endometriosis are pain, particularly pelvic pain, and infertility. The pain often is worse with the menstrual cycle. Endometriosis is typically seen during the reproductive years, and has been estimated to occur in roughly 6-10% of women. Current treatments are primarily pain management, hormone treatment, and surgery.

"In addition to infertility, the other primary symptom of endometriosis is recurring pelvic pain. The pain can range from mild to severe cramping or stabbing pain that occurs on both sides of the pelvis, in the lower back and rectal area, and even down the legs. The amount of pain a woman feels correlates poorly with the extent or stage (1 through 4) of endometriosis, with some women having little or no pain despite having extensive endometriosis or endometriosis with scarring, while other women may have severe pain even though they have only a few small areas of endometriosis. Thus, pain is a poor indicator of the extent of the condition.

"Endometriosis lesions may bleed and swell. This can trigger both an inflammatory response and pain. However, the pathophysiology of the condition is multifactorial and aspects of that pathophysiology broadly include underlying predisposing factors, inflammation, metabolic changes, formation of ectopic endometrium, and generation of pain. Adhesions may form, thereby causing both pain and additional complications such as organ dislocation. Recently, it has been shown that there are elevated levels of IL-10, IL-12(p70), MIP1a, MIP b, and TNFα in the supernatant of peritoneal macrophages from subjects with endometriosis.

"It is well-known in the art that normalization to body surface area is an appropriate method for extrapolating doses between species. To calculate the human equivalent dose (HED) from a dosage used in the treatment of age-dependent cognitive impairment in rats, the formula HED (mg/kg)=rat dose (mg/kg)×0.16 may be employed (see Estimating the Safe Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers, December 2002, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research). For example, using that formula, a dosage of 10 mg/kg in rats is equivalent to 1.6 mg/kg in humans. This conversion is based on a more general formula HED=animal dose in mg/kg×(animal weight in kg/human weight in kg)0.33. Similarly, to calculate the HED can be calculated from a dosage used in the treatment in mouse, the formula HED (mg/kg)=mouse dose (mg/kg)×0.08 may be employed (see Estimating the Safe Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers, December 2002, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research).

"3-phenacyl-UDP (also referred to as PSB0474) is a potent and selective P2Y6 receptor agonist (EC50=70 nM, >500-fold selective). In this study, P2Y6 receptor was activated in vivo using 3-phenacyl-UDP (PSB0474). The effect of this activation may have on plaque burden was also evaluated.

"PSB0474 was systemically administered to PSAPP mice via intraperitoneal injection for 2, 4 and 6 consecutive days. In one group, prior to evaluation and following to administration for 6 consecutive days, treatment was suspended for two weeks (6+2 weeks group). Brains were then fixed and plaque load was evaluated by immunostaining with the amyloid beta specific antibodies: β1-40 and β1-42. Representative images of plaque load in cortex and hippocampus from animals that received injections of PSB0474 according to the foregoing injection schedules are shown in FIGS. 1(A)-(D). Quantitative data showed that administration of PSB0474 for 4 and 6 consecutive days significantly decreased immunoreactivity of β1-40 in both cortex and hippocampus (FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)). Whereas, when administration of PSB0474 was stopped for 2 weeks following six consecutive days of treatment (denoted as the 6+2 weeks group), β1-40 staining rebounded; although to a level lower than observed in mice treated with saline as a vehicle control. FIGS. 2A and 6B depict the reduction in plaque load (%) the cortex and hippocampus, respectively, in PSAPP mice after treatment with 3-phenacyl-UDP for 2, 4, or 6 consecutive days, as assayed by staining with the β1-40 antibody. FIGS. 2C-2F depict data obtained following administration of different dosages of PSB0474. It is important to note that a 1000× increase in dose of PSB0474 did not cause detrimental effects to the animal, suggesting that there is a wide therapeutic window for P2Y6 receptor agonists. However, with the higher dose of 1 mg/kg we did observe smaller effects on the efficacy endpoint presumably because the enhanced receptor occupancy led to some desensitization/internalization of the P2Y6 receptor. This result indicates that activation of P2Y6 receptor significantly attenuated plaque load in both the cortex and hippocampus in PSAPP mice.

"P2Y6 Modulating Compounds Mediate Cytokine Release in Human THP-1 Cells
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"THP-1 cells, a human cell line derived from monocytes, were treated in vitro with vehicle, the P2Y6 receptor antagonist MRS 2578, or compound 5, singly or in combination. THP-1 cells were seeded in 24 well plates at a density of 4×105 cells/well in culture medium for 24 hours. Thereafter, vehicle, compound 5, or MRS 2578 (singly or in combination) were added to the cultures for 24 hours. Subsequently the culture medium was aspirated and subjected to multiplex cytokine analysis. Data are presented as means+/−sem. See FIGS. 18 and 19. MRS 2578 has a molecular weight of about 472 and is also described using CAS number 711019-86-2.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"As summarized in FIG. 18, treatment of human THP-1 cells with the P2Y6 receptor antagonist MRS 2578 increased the release of certain cytokines from the cells, as measured by an increase in the observed concentration of particular cytokines in the culture medium, consistent with an anti-inflammatory effect endogenously exerted by this receptor. Numerous cytokines were evaluated, and data for fractalkine, PDGF-BB, and IL-7 are shown in FIG. 18. Observed concentration of these cytokines in the culture medium, following treatment, is indicated along the y-axis in pg/ml. In FIG. 18, the asterisks correspond to the following p values: * p<0.05; ** p<0.02; *** p<0.002.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt
"Moreover, our studies in human THP-1 cells showed that the effects of modulating P2Y6 receptor activity were reciprocal. Specifically, treating cells in culture with compound 5 (10 nM) reduced the release of cytokines. This is consistent with the inhibitory affects on plasma cytokine concentration observed following administration of compound 5 to mice. This inhibitory affect was blocked by co-incubating the cells in both compound 5 and the P2Y6 receptor antagonist MRS 2578. FIG. 19 summarizes the results of an experiment in which IL-7 release from human THP-1 cells was examined.
",0,US20180085386A1.txt

Concentration of cytokine secreted into the culture media is measured in pg/ml, as represented on the y-axis. Treatment with MRS 2578 increased release of IL-7 from human THP-1 cells. Treatment with compound 5 decreased release of IL-7 from human THP-1 cells, and this effect was abrogated by co-treatment with MRS 2578.

"BACKGROUND ART
",0,US20180037547A1.txt
"In general, an organic light emitting phenomenon refers to a phenomenon in which electric energy is converted into light energy by using an organic material. An organic light emitting device using the organic light emitting phenomenon usually has a structure including a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and an organic material layer interposed therebetween. Here, the organic material layer may have a multi-layered structure composed of different materials in order to improve the efficiency and stability of an organic light emitting device in many cases, and for example, may be composed of a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transport layer, an electron injection layer, and the like. In the structure of the organic light emitting device, if a voltage is applied between two electrodes, holes are injected from a positive electrode into the organic material layer and electrons are injected from a negative electrode into the organic material layer, and when the injected holes and electrons meet each other, an exciton is formed, and light is emitted when the exciton falls down again to a ground state.

"There is a continuous need for developing a new material for the aforementioned organic light emitting device.

"The present invention relates to a synthetic route to bis-quaternary pyridinium oximes which can be utilized to restore activity of acetylcholinesterase inhibited by combination with organophosphates.
",0,US10633340B1.txt
"BACKGROUND
",0,US10633340B1.txt
"Stimulating signals are typically carried by acetylcholine within a nervous system synapse. Such signals may be discontinued by a specific type of cholinesterase enzymes, acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down acetylcholine. If cholinesterase inhibiting chemicals are present, they may then prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine thereby disrupting normal nervous system activity. For example, certain chemical classes of pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, may result in toxic cholinesterase inhibition. Accordingly, if an individual is regularly exposed to such inhibitors, there remains a need to prophylactically or therapeutically treat such toxicity. Among other things, individuals or animals who may have been exposed to a carbamate type cholinesterase inhibitor may currently be treated with atropine, and those exposed to organophosphates may beneficially be treated with a pralidoxime antidote.
",0,US10633340B1.txt
"Organophosphorous nerve agents (OPNA) have been used as chemical weapons, and as noted, in pesticides, have reportedly cause an estimated 300,000 deaths per year worldwide. See, e.g., Eyer, P. et al, Toxicol. Rev. 2003, 22, 165-90. Currently, the bis-pyridinium oximes known as: (1) HLo-7 dimethylsulfate (DMS), otherwise known as 1-[[[4-(aminocarbonyl)pyridinio]methoxy]methyl]-2,4-bis [(hydroxyimino)methyl]pyridinium dimethane sulfonate); (2) HI-6 DMS, otherwise known as (1-[[[4-(aminocarbonyl)pyridinio]methoxy]methyl]-2-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]pyridinium dimethane sulfonate); and (3) obidoxime DMS, otherwise known as oxo-[[1-[[4-(oxoazaniumylmethylidene)pyridin-1-yl]methoxymethyl]pyridin-4-ylidene]methyl]azanium dimethane sulfonate, are reportedly among the most effective reactivators of OPNA inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
",0,US10633340B1.txt
"However, current methods to synthesize the above referenced antidotes require the use of chemical compounds which are extremely toxic and which lead to relatively large amounts of side products that are difficult to remove from the reaction media. Accordingly, a continuing need exists for more efficient pathways to produced desired reactivators of OPNA inhibited AChE.

"DETAILED DESCRIPTION
",0,US10633340B1.txt
"As noted above, current methods to synthesize HLo-7 DMS, HI-6 DMS and obidoxime DMS require use of chemical linkers such as bis(2-chloromethyl) ether (BCME) (2) or bis(2-methylsulfonoxymethyl) ether (BMME) (3), which are identified as extremely carcinogenic, with an exposure limit of 0.0003 ppm. In addition, BMME is relatively difficult to prepare and is unstable. Below is a summary of the relevant chemical reactions utilized employing such toxic reagents:

"In the above scheme, R1, R2, R3 and R4 may be independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, —CH═NOH or —CONH2. Reference to —OMS is reference to —OSO2CH3. Reference to X− is therefore reference to the anionic form, either Cl—, Br—, I— or −OSO2CH3. Accordingly, in compound 6, when R1 is hydrogen, R2 is —CH═NOH, and R3 and R4 are both —CH═NOH, and X− is −OSO2CH3, the compound is HLo-7. When R1=—CH═NOH, R2 is hydrogen, R3 is hydrogen and R4 is —CH═NOH, and X− is −OSO2CH3, the compound is HI-6 DMS. When R1 and R3 are hydrogen, and R2 and R4 are —CH═NOH, and X− is −OSO2CH3, the compound is obidoxime DMS. As can be seen from the above, aside from the use of relatively toxic reagents (BCME or BMME), these methods produce relatively large amounts of symmetrical side products 7 and 8, which are relatively difficult to remove from the desired oximes.

"The present invention is directed at the formation of a dibenzoyloxymethyl ether 10 which can be formed by reacting compound 9, a benzoic anhydride, optionally containing one or more electron withdrawing groups (EWG) on each of the two aromatic rings, preferably in the ortho and/or para position with respect to the carbonyl functionality, with trioxane and H2SO4 as an acid catalyst. Preferably, each aromatic ring on compound 9 contains one or two electron withdrawing groups. Accordingly, the reaction occurs preferably in an organic solvent, such as dicholorethane (DCE), where the optional and preferred one or more EWG is illustrated on the reaction scheme below:

"In the above, the optional electron withdrawing groups (EWG), if present, may be preferably and independently selected from an organic trihalide (—CF3, —CCl3), sulfonate (—SO3H), nitro group (˜NO2), ammonium (—NH3+), aldehyde (—CHO), ketones (—COR), carboxylic acid (—COOH), acyl chloride (—COCl), benzoate esters (—COOPh), amide (—CONH2) or halides (—F, —Cl, —Br, —I). Preferably, the EWG is the same on each of the two aromatic rings.

"As illustrated below, when an additional Lewis acid and a second substituted pyridine such as compound 5 is added and reacted with compound 11 the desired bis-pyridinium OPNA antidotes 6 are formed at a yield in the range of 30-90%. Preferred Lewis acids include trimethylsilyl iodide (TMSI), Trimethylsilyloxytrifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf), BF3.OEt2 or Trimethylsilyloxymethanesulfonate (TMSOMs). It should be noted that in this synthetic scheme, R1, R2, R3 and R4 may be independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, —CH═NOH or —CONH2. In addition, to X− is again reference to the anionic form, either Cl—, Br—, I— or −OSO2CH3. Reference to alkyl groups preferably include, e.g., methyl (—CH3), ethyl (—CH2CH3), propyl (—CH2CH2CH3) or butyl (—CH2CH2CH2CH3) groups.

"Accordingly, the present invention relates to a synthetic procedure for the formation of bis-quaternary pyridinium oximes which can be utilized to restore activity of acetylcholinesterase by combination with organophosphates. The procedure avoids the use of bis(2-chloromethyl) ether (BCME) (2) or bis(2-methylsulfonoxymethyl) ether (BMME) (3) as well as the formation of compounds 7 and 8 (symmetrical alkylation side products). Moreover, once prepared, the bis-quaternary pyridinium oximes may be readily incorporated into a pharmaceutically accepted carrier and administered in an antidotal amount to therapeutically treat exposure to a phosphorous containing cholinesterase inhibitor. A pharmaceutical accepted carrier may be understood herein as an aqueous formulation containing the bis-quaternary pyridinium oximes in the form of an aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier herein may also include other diluents suitable for preparing oral pharmaceutical suspensions. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable additives including stabilizing agents, suspending agents, surface tension modifiers, viscosity modifiers, colorants, preservatives, flavoring agents.

"Chiral boronic acids and their derivatives are highly versatile building blocks in modern asymmetric synthesis. Their stereospecific conversion into a broad range of useful functional groups is a continually growing and important research area. Additionally, many unique biological activities of boron-containing compounds have been revealed. Among them, chiral α(alfa)-aminoboronic acids have received significant attention since they are the key pharmacophores in protease inhibitions such as Bortezomib (Velcade, an anti-cancer drug and the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor) and Ixazomib (Ninlaro, a drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma). In addition, many other α-aminoboronic acid compounds showed excellent anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial activities. From the success of these compounds, there has been an increased interest in searching α-amino boronate-containing small bioactive molecules (FIG. 1).

"In view of their broad biological activities, substantial efforts have been made to develop synthetic methods for the asymmetric construction of α-aminoboronic acids and their derivatives. Previous approaches by either use of chiral auxiliaries or asymmetric catalytic transformations have been utilized for the efficient preparation of a variety of α-aminoboronic acid derivatives, whereas they mainly limited to the construction of chiral α-amino secondary boronic esters.
",0,US20200079799A1.txt
"Indeed, there have been only a limited number of reports on asymmetric approaches to more sterically congested α-amino tertiary boronic esters, which involves a particular challenge for the stereoselective construction of N-substituted quaternary carbon stereogenic centers (Scheme 1). For example, significant lower enantioselectivity was observed for the synthesis sterically hindered α-amino tertiary boronic esters compared to secondary boronic esters by borylation of imines and Cu-catalyzed hydroamination of alkenyl dan-boronates. Recently, Ellman reported a copper-catalyzed diastereoselective borylation of chiral N-tert-butanesufinyl ketimines with involvement of a chiral auxiliary (Scheme 1, eq 1). See A. W. Buesking, V. Bacauanu, I. Cai, J. A. Ellman, J. Org. Chem. 2014, 79, 3671-3677. In another approach, Tang described an elegant enantiospecific synthesis of N-substituted quaternary α-aminoboronic esters by rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of α-arylenamides (Scheme 1, eq 2). See N. Hu, G. Zhao, Y. Zhang, X. Liu, G. Li, W. Tang, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 6746-6749. Very recently, Ready and Studer developed transition-metal catalyzed enantiospecific and diastereoselective multi-component coupling involving indolylboron ate complexes to provide α-substituted indoline boronic esters, respectively (Scheme 1, eq 3 and eq 4). See S. Panda, J. M. Ready, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 6038-6041; b) S. Das, C. G. Daniliuc, A. Studer, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2018, 57, 4053-4057.

"The lithiation of 1 using sec-BuLi at −78° C. was completed in 30 min to generate the corresponding organolithium species. Then various conditions for the enantiospecific borylation of α-lithiated tertiary N-benzylic carbamate were examined. The investigation was initiated by using iPrOBpin and MeOBpin as borylation reagents, but no borylation occurred at −78° C. (Table 1, entries 1 and 3). To facilitate the borylation, the reaction was carried out initially at −78° C. and slowly increased the reaction temperature to 23° C. in 12 h. In these cases, the desired borylated product 2 (DG═Boc) was obtained in 55% and 56% yield, but only in 80% ee and 88% ee, respectively (Table 1, entries 2 and 4). The low enantiopurities are most likely to result from increasing reaction temperature to enable the sluggish desired borylation of the tertiary α-N-substituted organolithium species with less nucleophilicity due to the steric hindrance and the adjacent electron-withdrawing N-DG group. This problem could be circumvented by using less hindered and more reactive boron electrophile reagents to promote the borylation at low temperature with excellent enantiospecificity. It was surprisingly found that pinacolborane (HBpin) reacted readily with α-N-substituted organolithium species at −78° C. to give exclusively a borylated product in 99% yield and >99% ee (Table 1, entry 6). When directing group of Boc was replaced with CON(iPr)2, the corresponding borylated product was obtained in 80% yield and 97% ee (Table 1, entry 8).
",0,US20200079799A1.txt
"After establishing the optimal reaction conditions, this novel enantiospecific borylation was applied to broad substrate scope. As can be seen in FIG. 2, various substituents of N-Boc protected amines, such as aryls with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, alkyls with OMe, Br, and double bond, can undergo lithiation-borylation process smoothly affording a series of α-amino tertiary boronic esters in excellent yields and extremely high enantiopurities. Notably, this enantiospecific borylation was also tolerant of N-Boc protected tetrahydroisoquinoline providing 2j in 92% yield with >98% ee. In the case of 2c, the lithiation occurred at both positions adjacent to nitrogen of N-Boc due to OMe group acting as an additional directing group for lithiation at CH2N-Boc, thus furnishing an approximate 1:2 ratio of CH2/benzylic borylated products. Switching sBuLi to nBuLi as the base resulted in a completely regioselective deprotonation at the benzylic position and subsequent addition of HBpin provided 2c in 82% yield with complete stereocontrol (>99% ee). Standard reaction conditions to prepare compounds of FIG. 2 is: i) amine (0.25 mmol, 1.0 equiv), sBuLi (1.2 equiv) at −78° C. for 0.5 h, ii) neat HBpin (1.5 equiv) at −78° C. for 2.5 h. [a] nBuLi was replaced with sBuLi. [b] TMEDA (1.5 equiv) was added.

"The enantiospecific borylation process can be extended to the substrates with multiple chiral centers. As shown in FIG. 3, the reaction was tolerant of N-Boc protected amines containing various functional groups such as halides (3a, 3b), olefin (3d-e, 3h-k), alkyne (3c), OTBPDS, hetero-rings (3b, 3f, 3h). In these cases, the desired α-amino tertiary boronic esters 3 were obtained in good to excellent yields and, importantly, with complete retention of configuration, as determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis of 3a and 3b. The coordination between the boron atom and the carbonyl group of Boc makes such α-amino tertiary boronic esters highly stable. Notably, both enantiopure α-amino tertiary boronic esters (R,S)-3d and (S,S)-3e were prepared from the corresponding (R,S)- and (S,S)-N-Boc amines with complete enantiospecificity in 96% and 90% yield, respectively. This result indicates that there is no matched/mismatched issue here, which can often complicate reaction outcomes. The compounds illustrated in FIG. 3 are made with substantially same method as shown for FIG. 2.

"The chiral α-amino tertiary boronic esters can be employed for further transformations to synthesize various chiral derivatives (FIG. 4). For example, 3a was transformed to 4 in 58% yield and 5 in 72% yield by Pd-catalyzed borylation and Pd-catalyzed Negishi coupling, respectively. Treatment of 2a of >99% ee with 4N HCl to remove the Boc group followed by the amide formation provided peptide 6 in 55% overall yield, and importantly, only a single diastereomer was obtained. Treatment of 2k provides compound 7 with over 98% ee.

"In conclusion, a new and highly efficient enantiospecific borylation route to various chiral α-amino tertiary boronic esters has been successfully developed. This route employs N-Boc protected amines which are lithiated at −78° C. to generate configurationally stable organolithium species followed by the treatment with HBpin to undergo enantiospecific borylation, enabling the synthesis of a series of enantiopure (>99% ee) α-amino tertiary boronic esters with the formation of a new stereogenic C—B bond. Importantly, universally excellent enantiospecificity was observed. The current method is also applicable for gram-scale synthesis of 2a and 3a without erosion of enantiospecificity. The α-amino tertiary boronic esters can be further functionalized to provide various chiral compounds which hold a great potential for peptidomimetics of boron-based bioactive molecules.

"Since the Austrian scientist Reinitzer first synthesized a liquid crystal in 1888, the actual development of the liquid crystal industry is in the recent more than 30 years; since liquid crystal display materials have obvious advantages, such as a low drive voltage, a small power consumption, high reliability, a great display information amount, color display, no flicker, a capability of achieving panel display, etc., both liquid crystal monomers and liquid crystal displays have gone through a huge development, and liquid crystal monomers have been used in the synthesis of more than 10,000 kinds of liquid crystal materials, wherein there are thousands of common liquid crystal display materials, and by the classification according to the characteristics of the central bridge bond and rings of liquid crystal molecules, there are mainly biphenyl liquid crystals, phenyl cyclohexane liquid crystals, ester liquid crystals, alkynes, difluoromethoxy bridge types, ethane types and heterocyclic types. The liquid crystal display is also developed from TN and STN of black and white small screen in 30 years ago to the current TN-TFT, VA-TFT, IPS-TFT, PDLC of scale color screen, etc.

",0,US20180112132A1.txt
"In the various display modes, liquid crystal cells have different designs and different driving methods, and the orientations of liquid crystal molecular directors with respect to glass substrates are different, wherein in the optical compensation bending mode (OCB) and the coplanar transformation liquid crystal display (IPS), liquid crystal molecular directors are parallel to the direction of the glass substrates, while in the vertical alignment mode (VA) and the axisymmetric microstructure liquid crystal display (ASM), the liquid crystal molecular directors are perpendicular to the direction of the glass substrates in the absence of an electric field.

"With regard to the IPS of the parallel arranged mode, the dielectric anisotropy (Δε) of the crystal may be either positive or negative.
",0,US20180112132A1.txt
"In the vertical alignment mode (VA), all liquid crystal molecules in a null field are perpendicular to the direction of the glass substrates and parallel to a vertical incident light. When a polarizer is orthogonal, a good dark state is shown; therefore, this kind of device has a good contrast, and the dielectric anisotropy (Δε) of the crystal used has to be negative. The optical anisotropy (Δn) of the crystal, the thickness (d) of the liquid crystal cell and the wavelength (λ) of the incident light barely affect the contrast. The response time of the vertical alignment mode (VA) is much shorter than that of a twist-type device and is about half of that. Under the influence of an applied voltage, a VA device mainly produces a bending deformation of liquid crystal molecules, ECB produces a splay deformation of liquid crystal molecules, and the twisted display produces a twist deformation of liquid crystal molecules; the response times thereof are also inversely proportional to bending, splay, and twist elastic constants, respectively, because in general cases for most liquid crystals, the bending elastic constant of liquid crystal is greater than the splay elastic constant and the splay elastic constant is greater than the twist elastic constant, which is also the reason why the VA device has a faster response time.

Since the presence of the two side fluorines and the rigid structure dibenzofuran in the molecule limits the deflection between the two benzene rings, this type of compound has a higher absolute value of dielectric anisotropy and a very high birefringence. However, also because of the presence of the rigid dibenzofuran ring, such an alkyl-substituted liquid crystal compound has a poorer intersolubility and readily precipitates at low temperatures. In order to enable the performance of a display device to be closer to ideal, people have always been working to study new liquid crystal compounds, which allows the performances of liquid crystal compounds and display devices to continuously advance.

"Due to the presence of the rigid structure and the two side fluorines in the molecule, dibenzofuran-based crystals exhibit greater negative dielectric constants, and the presence of the rigid structure also results in a poorer the solubility of such compounds, which limits the use thereof. Surprisingly, when a cycloalkyl group is introduced into the dibenzofuran liquid crystal molecule, the resulting liquid crystal compound exhibits a better intersolubility than this type of liquid crystal compounds traditionally having flexible alkyl chains as terminal groups, and thus the use of a compound as represented by formula I provided by the present invention can improve the intersolubility of a liquid crystal compound and extend the application range of a liquid crystal mixture, producing an important application value.

"Molecular targeting treatment, which is a treatment method of performing treatment by using a certain molecule as a target and controlling its functions, is currently receiving attention widely. Such molecular targeting treatment targets a gene or a protein present on the surface of cells of a disease (e.g., cancer cells) and can thereby decrease the attack to normal cells by drugs so that adverse reactions can be reduced.

"The eukaryotic genomes constitute chromatin (chromosomes) and are thereby packed into the nucleus. The chromatin structure is formed by the repeat of nucleosome structures constituted by DNA and histones. In recent years, the chromatin has been found to be also deeply involved in a control mechanism called epigenetics (Non Patent Literature 1). The epigenetics refer to a control mechanism that regulates transcriptional activation, etc. by acquired modification without involving change in the sequence of DNA. Among others, modification in histones which are major proteins constituting the nucleosomes has significant influence on transcription and replication or repair.

"PIP is an artificial small molecule developed with an antibiotic distamycin as a motif and reportedly binds in a sequence-specific manner to a minor group of double-stranded DNA, and there are many reports as to research on the silencing of a gene having a target sequence by PIP (Non Patent Literatures 4, 5, and 6). Furthermore, PIP is under research as a drug for kidney damage, an anticancer agent, or a therapeutic drug for corneal trauma, hypertrophic scar, bone disease, and the like by animal experiments using mice. Also, PIP is an organic small molecule expected to produce various research achievements in such a way that the induction of iPS cells by PIP has been researched in recent years at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), which is the iPS cell project of the Kyoto University, as a part of research on iPS cells.

"Examples of the features of PIP include: (1) PIP can be designed to target an arbitrary gene sequence; (2) its ability to bind to DNA is stronger than that of a transcription factor; (3) PIP is taken up into the nuclei of cells without any vector or drug delivery system (DDS); (4) PIP is stable in cells or organisms without being decomposed by a nucleolytic enzyme and excreted as an undecomposed product by urinary bile; and (5) PIP can be easily modified at its N and C termini and is capable of forming conjugates with various functional small molecules.

A HAT activator differs in mechanism of action from the HDAC inhibitor described above from the viewpoint of histone modification and can therefore activate a different particular gene. It is also expected that the HAT activator can activate a particular gene synergistically or cooperatively by combination with the HDAC inhibitor.

",0,EP3257527A1.txt
"The histone acetyltransferase (abbreviated to ""HAT"") of the present invention is an enzyme that highly acetylates histone proteins and participates in the activation of transcription. The histone acetylation adds negatively charged acetyl groups to histone proteins so that the histones are negatively charged to weaken the interaction between the histones and between DNA and the histones, thereby promoting dissociation. Therefore, nucleosome condensation is relaxed. It is considered that, as a result, condensation is also relaxed in a gene regulatory region to allow the binding of a transcription factor to the regulatory region, thereby promoting the expression of the gene.

"The ""polyamide for recognizing a regulatory region of a target gene"" which is a component of the conjugate of the present invention means a polyamide designed to recognize the regulatory region of the target gene. In this context, the phrase ""recognizing a regulatory region of a target gene"" means that the target-recognizing polyamide binds (e.g., by a hydrogen bond or crosslinking), for example, to the regulatory region of the target gene and/or the neighborhood thereof. Examples of the polyamide can include DNA-binding compounds such as pyrrole polyamide (PIP) (PIP compounds including a cyclic structure, a hairpin structure, and a tandem form in which hairpin structures are connected), peptide nucleic acid (PNA), bridged nucleic acid, locked nucleic acid (LNA), and complexes such as DNA-binding protein complexes (e.g., zinc finger).

"The ""pyrrole imidazole polyamide (referred to as PIP)"" of the present invention is a polyamide containing a N-methylpyrrole unit (Py), a N-methylimidazole unit (Im), and a γ-aminobutyric acid moiety, and Py, Im, and the γ-aminobutyric acid moiety are linked to each other via an amide bond (-C(=O)-NH-) (Trauger et al., Nature, 382, 559-61 (1996); White et al., Chem Biol., 4, 569-78 (1997); and Dervan, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 9, 2215-35 (2001)). PIP is wholly folded into a U-shaped conformation (hairpin form) by the γ-aminobutyric acid moiety serving as a linker (γ-linker). In the U-shaped conformation, two chains containing Py and Im are arranged in parallel, flanking the linker. When a pair of Py and Im between these two chains is a particular combination (Py/Im pair, Im/Py pair, Py/Py pair, or Im/Im pair), this pair can bind to a particular base pair in DNA with high affinity. For example, the Py/Im pair can bind to a C-G base pair, and the Im/Py pair can bind to a G-C base pair. Also, the Py/Py pair can bind to both an A-T base pair and a T-A base pair (White et al., Chem. Biol., 4, 569-78 (1997); and Dervan, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 9, 2215-35 (2001)). PIP may additionally contain 3-hydroxypyrrole (Hp) or β alanine. As for Hp, a Hp/Py pair can bind to a T-A base pair (White et al., Nature, 391, 468-71 (1998)). The γ-linker may have a side chain having an amino group, such as N-α-N-γ-aminobutyric acid and N-β-N-γ-aminobutyric acid, which may be modified with a molecule such as FITC or biotin. Also, PIP may be modified at its N terminus with not only an acetyl group but a molecule such as FITC or biotin. β alanine/β alanine can bind to a T-A base pair or an A-T base pair. Accordingly, PIP recognizing the regulatory region of the target gene can be designed by changing, for example, the pairing combination of Py and Im according to the DNA sequence of the target. A design method and a production method for PIP are known in the art (e.g., Japanese Patent No. 3045706, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-136974, WO03/000683, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2013-234135, and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2014-173032).

"In the production method by liquid-phase reaction, the synthetic intermediate PIP having a carboxylic acid moiety needs to be purified in order to remove dimethylaminopropylamine used in the excision. This requires time and effort and also decreases yields due to the purification. In addition, disadvantageously, the CTB-PIP conjugate needs to be purified even after the final condensation step carried out by liquid-phase reaction. Use of the production method by solid-phase reaction can solve all of these problems.

"The disadvantage of the production method by solid-phase reaction includes, because of using a CTB derivative having a carboxylic acid moiety in the step of solid-phase reaction, a larger amount necessary for synthesis than that in the production method by liquid-phase reaction.

PIP was synthesized by the Fmoc solid-phase synthesis method from 43 mg of Fmoc-Py-oxime resin (approximately 0.42 mmol/g, 100-200 mesh). The reaction cycle is as follows: deprotection was performed twice (4 minutes each) using a DMF solution of 20% piperidine. Coupling was performed for 60 minutes using carboxylic acid, HCTU (88 mg), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (36 µL), and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Washing was performed five times (1 minute each) using DMF. Each coupling reagent per step was prepared as a NMP solution in the following amount: Fmoc-Py-COOH (77 mg), Fmoc-Im-COOH (77 mg), Fmoc-PyIm-COOH (70 mg), Fmoc-β-COOH (66 mg), Fmoc-γ-COOH (69 mg), and adipic acid (31 mg). All condensation steps were performed by single coupling, and stirring was performed by the bubbling of nitrogen gas. As a typical example, 40 mg of a resin and 1 mL of NMP were placed in a 2.5-mL plastic reaction vessel and left for 30 minutes to swell the resin. Fmoc monomers, HCTU, and 1 mL of NMP were added to a 2-mL plastic centrifugal tube and placed at positions according to a sequence. All lines were washed with NMP after solution transfer. After the completion of synthesis, the resin was washed with a 0.1 N NaOH solution, washed with water, then washed twice with 1 mL of DMF and twice with 1 mL of methanol, and dried under reduced pressure at room temperature in a desiccator.

"Hepatitis C is a life-threatening viral infection that is wide spread in the world [Organization, W. H., Global hepatitis report 2017. 2017]. Initially, the virus infects liver cells but remains asymptomatic for an extended period [Dickson, R. C., Clinical manifestations of hepatitis C. Clinics in liver disease 1997, 1 (3), 569-85]. This is an epidemiological challenge because patients diagnosed with hepatitis C come from two pools; recently-infected and later-stage asymptomatic. The initial symptoms of hepatitis C such as fever, fatigue, nausea, and liver tenderness can be misleading because they are tolerated by most patients. After several years of infection, the virus activates, replicates, and causes complications that start with liver scarring, fibrosis followed by cirrhosis and eventually liver failure and carcinoma [Friedrich, M. J., Third millennium challenge: hepatitis C. Jama 1999, 282 (3), 221-2]. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is usually transmitted via the blood of an infected person [Bocket, L.; Chevaliez, S.; Talbodec, N.; Sobaszek, A.; Pawlotsky, J. M.; Yazdanpanah, Y., Occupational transmission of hepatitis C virus resulting from use of the same supermarket meat slicer. Clinical microbiology and infection: the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 2011, 17 (2), 238-41]. Awareness of hepatitis C health problems and forceful efforts to combat the spread on HCV in healthcare settings have led to a significant decline in new infection cases [Organization, W. H., Global hepatitis report 2017. 2017; and Hatzakis, A. et al. The present and future disease burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections with today's treatment paradigm—volume 2. J Viral Hepat 2015, 22 Suppl 1, 26-45]. However, the death toll from hepatitis C complications remains as high as 400,000 annually due to the above described unique clinical vs. epidemic profile of hepatitis C. An estimated 70 million people globally are infected with HCV, constituting a major health problem [Collaborators, P. O. H., Global prevalence and genotype distribution of hepatitis C virus infection in 2015: a modelling study. Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol 2017, 2 (3), 161-176]. In 2013, the death rate from hepatitis C complications surpassed that of HIV. In 2015, hepatitis C-related deaths exceeded those of tuberculosis and malaria combined [Stanaway, J. D. et al. The global burden of viral hepatitis from 1990 to 2013: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Lancet (London, England) 2016, 388 (10049), 1081-1088].

"Up until 2013, interferon (or pegylated interferon) and ribavirin were the most effective available therapies, however the long-term efficacies were as low as 3% [North, C. S.; Hong, B. A.; Adewuyi, S. A.; Pollio, D. E.; Jain, M. K.; Devereaux, R.; Quartey, N. A.; Ashitey, S.; Lee, W. M.; Lisker-Melman, M., Hepatitis C treatment and SVR: the gap between clinical trials and real-world treatment aspirations. General hospital psychiatry 2013, 35 (2), 122-8]. Identification of the hepatitis C genome and proteome in early 1990s prompted research efforts that led to development of direct antiviral agents (DAA) in 2011 including bocepreivir and telaprevir. The DAAs revolutionized the treatment of HCV infections9-11 and the current situation of the treatment looks promising. Nonetheless, new therapies will likely be needed to address emerging resistance of this rapidly mutating virus [Bartenschlager, R.; Baumert, T. F.; Bukh, J.; Houghton, M.; Lemon, S. M.; Lindenbach, B. D.; Lohmarni, V.; Moradpour, D.; Pietschmann, T.; Rice, C. M.; Thimme, R.; Wakita, T.

"The HCV genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to flaviviridae [Murray, C. L.; Jones, C. T.; Rice, C. M., Architects of assembly: roles of Flaviviridae non-structural proteins in virion morphogenesis. Nature reviews microbiology 2008, 6 (9), 699-708]. It is composed of about 9,400 nucleotides with highly conserved 5′ and 3′ terminal regions. The untranslated 5′ terminus is followed by a single open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein of 3010 to 3303 amino acids. The virus genome translates mainly to structural and non-structural proteins. The non-structural (NS) proteins including NS3, NS4A, NS4B NS5A and NS5B comprise proteins that are important for maturation and replication of the virus.
",0,US20200323822A1.txt
"NS3 dually functions as protease (N-terminal domain) and RNA helicase (C-terminal domain). When conformed as protease, NS3 catalyzes the processing of the viral proteome to functional proteins by cleaving NS3-NS4A, NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, and NS5A-NS5B junctions. NS5A is a non-enzymatic protein that is important for viral replication however the exact mechanism is poorly understood. NS5B is well characterized to be the viral RNA polymerase. NS4A is a small (54 amino acids) and versatile multi-functioning peptide. It acts as the activating cofactor of NS3 protease -terminal) and NS3 helicase (C-terminal) [Ishido, S.; Fujita, T.; Hotta, H., Complex formation of NS5B with NS3 and NS4A proteins of hepatitis C virus. Biochemical and biophysical research communications 1998, 244 (1), 35-40; and Kim, D. W.; Gwack, Y.; Han, J. H.; Choe, J., C-terminal domain of the hepatitis C virus NS3 protein contains an RNA helicase activity. Biochemical and biophysical research communications 1995, 215 (1), 160-166]. It is also important for the integration of NS3 to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum [Wölk, B.; Sansonno, D.; Kräusslich, H.-G.; Dammacco, F.; Rice, C. M.; Blum, H. E.; Moradpour, D., Subcellular localization, stability, and trans-cleavage competence of the hepatitis C virus NS3-NS4A complex expressed in tetracycline-regulated cell lines. Journal of virology 2000, 74 (5), 2293-2304] and neutralization of the immune response of the host cell towards the viral invasion [Li, K.; Foy, E.; Ferreon, J. C.; Nakamura, M.; Ferreon, A. C.; Ikeda, M.; Ray, S. C.; Gale, M.; Lemon, S. M., Immune evasion by hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease-mediated cleavage of the Toll-like receptor 3 adaptor protein TRIF.

Nature 2005, 437 (7062), 1167]. The current approved DAAs elevated the patient sustained cure to 95% in less than two months of use [Kardashian, A. A.; Pockros, P. J., Novel emerging treatments for hepatitis C infection: a fast-moving pipeline. Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology 2017, 10 (2), 277-282]. Drugs available for prescription are categorized to three classes: NS3/4A inhibitors, e.g. telap evir, boceprovir, simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir, grazopreivir, and voxilaprevir (binding at the substrate site), NSSA inhibitors, e.g. daclatasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, elbasvir, and velpatasvir, and NS5B inhibitors, e.g. soforbuvir, and dasabuvir [Feld, J. J., Direct-Acting Antivirals for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV): The Progress Continues. Current drug targets 2017, 18 (7), 851-862].

"The use of DAA combinations with high rates of sustained viral recovery (SVR) became routine in therapy regimens [Aghemo, A.; Piroth, L.; Bhagani, S., What do clinicians need to watch for with direct-acting antiviral therapy? Journal of the International AIDS Society 2018, 21 Suppl 2, e25076]. For instance, a combination of voxilaprevir (NS3/4A inhibitor), velpatasvir (NSSA inhibitor), and sofosbuvir (NSSB inhibitor) that covers all HCV genotypes 1-6 has been prescribed to patients suffering relapse subsequent to failure of DAA monotherapy [Chahine, E.

"As outlined in the World Health Organization Global Hepatitis Report, there are several remaining challenges that must be met to eradicate HCV by 2030 [Organization, W. H., Global hepatitis report 2017. 2017]: 1) access to the treatment in economically-challenged areas must be increased [Chhatwal, J.; Chen, Q.; Aggarwal, R., Estimation of Hepatitis C Disease Burden and Budget Impact of Treatment Using Health Economic Modeling. Inject Dis Clin North Am 2018, 32 (2), 461-480]; 2) emerging drug resistance must be addressed [Cuypers, L.; Libin, P.; Schrooten, Y.; Theys, K.; Di Maio, V. C.; Cento, V.; Lunar, M. M.; Nevens, F.; Poljak, M.; Ceccherini-Silberstein, F., Exploring resistance pathways for first-generation NS3/4A protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir using Bayesian network learning. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 2017, 53, 15-23]; 3) efficacy in broader sectors of HCV patients, such as elder and impaired kidney or liver patients, must be increased [Hellard, M. E.; Chou, R; Easterbrook, P., WHO guidelines on testing for hepatitis B and. C meeting targets for testing. BioMed Central: 2017]. Thus, there is a clear need to identify new approaches to inhibit viral protein targets and treat HCV infection. The current disclosure introduces a new class of compounds that interfere with NS4A in its binding with NS3 protease and deactivate the enzyme [Joyce, M.; Williams, M.; Hindsgaul, O.; Tyrrell, D.

"As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to a physical association of a compound of this disclosure with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. Solvate encompasses both solution phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvents include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, ethyl acetate and other lower alkanols, glycerine, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl acetate (DMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropyl ether, acetonitrile, toluene, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetrahydropyran, other cyclic mono-, di- and tri-ethers, polyalkylene glycols (e.g. polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol), and mixtures thereof in suitable proportions.

",0,US20200323822A1.txt
"As used herein, the term “tautomer” refers to constitutional isomers of organic compounds that readily convert by tautomerization or tautomerism. The interconversion commonly results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom or proton, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and adjacent double bond. Tautomerism is a special case of structural isomerism, and because of the rapid interconversion, tautomers are generally considered to be the same chemical compound. In solutions in which tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors including, but not limited to, temperature, solvent and pH. Exemplary common tautomeric pairs include, but are not limited to, ketone and enol, enamine and imine, ketene and ynol, nitroso and oxime, amide and imidic acid, lactam and lactim (an amide and imidic tautomerism in heterocyclic rings), and open-chain and cyclic fowls of an acetal or hemiacetal (e.g., in reducing sugars).

"As used herein, the term “stereoisomer” refers to isomeric molecules that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (i.e. constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space. This contrasts with structural isomers, which share the same molecular formula, but the bond connection of their order differs. By definition, molecules that are stereoisomers of each other represent the same structural isomer. Enantiomers are two stereoisomers that are related to each other by reflection, they are non-superimposable mirror images. Every stereogenic center in one has the opposite configuration in the other. Two compounds that are enantiomers of each other have the same physical properties, except for the direction in which they rotate polarized light and how they interact with different optical isomers of other compounds. Diastereomers are stereoisomers not related through a reflection operation, they are not mirror images of each other. These include meso compounds, cis- and trans- (E- and Z-) isomers, and non-enantiomeric optical isomers. Diastereomers seldom have the same physical properties. In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers may refer to enantiomers, diastereomers, or both.

"Conformers, rotamers, or conformational isomerism refers to a form of isomerism that describes the phenomenon of molecules with the same structural formula but with different shapes due to rotations around one or more bonds. Different conformations can have different energies, can usually interconvert, and are very rarely isolatable. There are some molecules that can be isolated in several conformations. Atropisomers are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers. In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers may refer to conformers, atropisomers, or both.

"Drug research and development efforts made by global research institutions and pharmaceutical industries have been focused on other HCV targets rather than NS4A. NS4A binding pocket remained an under-explored target for discovering new antiviral agents, which may possibly overcome emerging resistance against available drugs. Structurally, NS4A is a small peptide with 54 amino acids, which are inclined of forming proper assembly with other viral proteins. For instance, the hydrophobic N-terminal initiates a sandwich-filling binding that brings the N-terminal (A0 and A1 sheets) of the NS3 to rearrange and conform properly. This process is critical for the enzyme's catalytic site to attain a suitable shape that accommodates the peptide substrate [De Francesco, R.; Tomei, L.; Altamura, S.; Summa, V.; Migliaccio, G., Approaching a new era for hepatitis C virus therapy: inhibitors of the N53-4A serine protease and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

S., The NS4A cofactor dependent enhancement of HCV NS3 protease activity correlates with a 4D geometrical measure of the catalytic triad region. PloS one 2016, 11 (12), e0168002]. It was found that the central part of NS4A (Gly21-Leu34) with only 14 amino acids is required for the activation of NS3 protease. Shimizu et al. observed inhibition of the enzyme via mutating the basic Arg-28 residue to a neutral glutamine (Gin) [Shimizu, Y.; Yamaji, K.; Masuho, Y.; Yokota, T.; Inoue, H; Sudo, K.; Satoh, S.; Shimotohno, K., Identification of the sequence on NS4A required for enhanced cleavage of the NS5A/513 site by hepatitis C virus NS3 protease.

"After careful inspection of 3D-visualization of crystal structures of NS4A in bound form, it was found that it faints a β-sheet that is mostly extended except a turn featuring a nearly planar area composed of an eclipsed cis bond and four trans bonds with the backbone that span through Val-26 to Arg-28. This turn is facilitated by the presence of the Gly-27 due to its small size (no side chains) (see FIG. 1). Accordingly, the compounds of formulae (I) and (II) disclosed herein are proposed via a De novo structure-based design by deriving the planar area into imidazole nucleus.

"calorimetric methods include but not limited to isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry. SPR is the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons at the interface between negative and positive permittivity material stimulated by incident light. The method involves immobilizing one molecule of a binding pair on the sensor chip surface (“ligand”, in Biacore parlance) and injecting a series of concentrations of its partner (“analyte”) across the surface. Changes in the index of refraction at the surface where the binding interaction occurs are detected by the hardware and recorded as RU (resonance units) in the control software. Curves are generated from the RU trace and are evaluated by fitting algorithms which compare the raw data to well-defined binding models. These fits allow determination of a variety of thermodynamic constants, including the apparent affinity of the binding interaction.

"The kinetics of enzymatic-catalyzed reactions is a useful tool not only to determine the inhibition constants (Ki) for an inhibitor but also the site at which an inhibitor binds to the enzyme. An inhibitor that binds exclusively to the catalytic active site displays a competitive inhibition pattern with the substrate. In contrast, an inhibitor that binds to a different site from that of the substrate displays an uncompetitive inhibition pattern with the substrate. If the inhibitor binds to both an active site and a different site from that of the active site, it would display a non-competitive pattern. Thus, the active ingredient (e.g. the compound of formula (I)) would be competitive with the activation peptide and uncompetitive with the substrate.

"The fluorescence method is suitable for high throughput screening method amenable to automation in a laboratory environment. Since HCV NS3 contains two tryptophan residues and four tyrosine residues, the binding of an inhibitor (e.g. the compound of formula (I), NS4A) to the activation site may be accompanied by significant change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein, and hence the enzyme inhibition may be evaluated (see FIG. 6). A peptide inhibitor (e.g. NS4A) may be labeled with a fluorescent probe and the binding of the labeled peptide to the enzyme is accompanied by fluorescent change (see Example 12, 13, FIG. 6).

Cell 1996, 87 (2), 343-355]. Therefore, a synthetic gene for NS3 domain was subcloned in the expression vector pET-3a. In the process, a 100 mL of bacterial culture in Luria Broth medium was grown overnight at 37° C. and used for inoculation of 10 L LB in a 14-liter fermenter flask (New Brunswick Scientific Co., CT, USA). The media was supplemented with 50 μg/mL ampicillin. The culture grew until the OD600 reached 0.5-0.6, then it was cooled to 25° C. and 1 mM IPTG was added. Expression was followed overnight, and then cells were harvested.

"The produced protein was purified using equilibrated Ni-NTA beads and the poly-histidine tag was not removed. In the process, cells were re-suspended (1 g/5 mL) in buffer (50 mM HEPES, 0.3 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8). Lysozymes were added (1 mg/mL) followed by protease inhibitor cocktail tablet and the suspension was sonicated. Cell lysate was centrifuged to collect the clear supernatant that contained the desired NS3 protein. The protein was purified using pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, USA). Beads were washed with buffer (50 mM HEPES, 0.3 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8) and eluted with another buffer (50 mM HEPES, 0.3 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 350 mM imidazole, pH 8). Fractions were collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 3000 MWCO centrifugal device (Millipore, Germany). Protein purity after Ni-affinity purification step was not less than 70%. The purity, as estimated by SDS-PAGE, was sufficient to perform all investigations of this study and the protein was stable for several hours at test conditions (see FIG. 4) [Massariol, Zhao, S.; Marquis, M.; Thibeault, D.; White, P. W., Protease and helicase activities of hepatitis C virus genotype 4, 5, and 6 NS3NS4A proteins. Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 2010, 391 (1), 692-697].

NS3 (4.0 μM) was mixed with MOC-23 (6.3 μM) for 15 minutes. Afterwards, 5-FAM/QXL™520 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptide was added as instructed by the assay kit manual. The sequence of this FRET peptide (5-FAM-SLGRKIQIQ) is derived from the cleavage site of NS4A/NS4B. In the FRET peptide, the fluorescence of 5-FAM is quenched by QXL™520. Upon cleavage into two separate fragments by HCV NS3/4A protease, the fluorescence of 5-FAM is recovered, and can be monitored at 490 nm/520 nm (excitation/emission). Controls included buffer, compound, compound±NS3, NS3+NS4A and FRET peptide separately. All test wells and controls were repeated in triplicates at the same 96-well plate.

"The binding affinity test was performed using fluorescence anisotropy technique. In this test, maximum fluorescence was first determined at optimal ratio of NS3 (1.8 μM) and FITC-NS4A (0.1 μM). Compounds that compete with NS4A should be able to decrease the fluorescence of this mixture because they prevent the binding to occur and it should be concentration-dependent. Results showed some compounds suppressed the fluorescence emitted upon binding of NS4A with NS3. However, we found that MOC-23 showed highest affinity and more reproducible results than other compounds (see FIG. 5). It could effectively compete with FITC-NS4A at dissociation constant Kd=6.303±0.3 μM). The reproducibility was checked using another batch of the express NS3 protein following the same procedure and the value was calculated=7.815±1.014 μM. Compound MOC-24 showed binding affinity at similar level but results were less reproducible and standard error was higher. Therefore, compound MOC-23 was tested for its ability to inhibit the NS3 enzyme. MOC-23 at its binding affinity concentration (6.3 μM) was able to inhibit NS3 and abolished any proteolytic activity of the enzyme (see FIG. 6).",0,US20200323822A1.txt
