"Whilst the moderate yield is disadvantageous the lack of selectivity poses the greater problem resulting not only in secondary but also tertiary amines as by-products. These by-products can only be separated off with difficulty by means of sublimation. Furthermore, a particular disadvantage is that intermediates used in the manufacture of organic light-emitting diodes are subject to particularly high purity requirements as unwanted, even structurally related impurities, even in small quantities, can lead to an undesirable shift in the emission wavelengths or to a reduction in the quantum yield and consequently to an undesirable waste heat generation.

Toluene (40 mL) and the catalyst stock solution (100 μL, 91.8 mg, 0.04 mmol palladium) were then added and the mixture heated for 20 hours to 70 CC. The reaction was followed by thin-layer chromatography and it was determined that the full conversion was achieved after this period. After cooling to room temperature, water (60 mL) was added and extracted using dichloromethane (150 mL). The organic phase was separated off, dried over magnesium sulfate (5 g) and filtered through basic aluminum oxide (10 g). The solvent was removed in vacuum (40° C., 10 mbar) and the slightly yellow residue washed with ether (3×20 mL). After drying in vacuum (2 h, 10−2 mbar), the product was obtained as a colorless solid (9.71 g, 18.4 mmol, 92%).

"All tests were carried out in 20 mL headspace vials for the gas chromatography, which vials were sealed with aluminum flange caps with teflon-coated butyl rubber septa (both available, for example, from VWR). To control the temperatures of the vessels, 8 cm-high cylindrical aluminum blocks were used, the diameter of which exactly corresponds to that of the hot plates of laboratory magnetic stirrers (e.g. Heidolph Mr 2002). These aluminum blocks were provided with ten 7 cm deep holes with the diameter of the reaction vessels and a hole for accommodating a temperature sensor.

"To enable the simultaneous evacuation and refilling of ten vessels, vacuum distributors were manufactured for connection to the Schlenk line. To this end, ten 3 mm vacuum-tight teflon hoses were respectively connected at one end to adapters to accommodate Luer Lock syringe needles and at the other end to a steel tube that can be connected to the Schlenk line via a vacuum hose.

"To carry out the tests, the aryl bromide (1.00 mmol), the corresponding primary amine (1.00 mmol) and sodium-tert-butanolate (118 mg, 1.20 mmol) were weighed out in air into the reaction vessels, 20 mm magnetic stirring bars were added and the vessels were sealed airtight with septa caps using flanging pliers. 10 reaction vessels were respectively inserted into the holes of an aluminum block and connected to the vacuum distributor via cannulas, which were bored through the septa caps.

"The reaction vessels were then collectively evacuated and flushed with nitrogen three times in succession. After the reaction vessels were provided with an inert gas atmosphere in this way, a pressure equalization with the outside atmosphere was created in the vacuum line via the relief valve. A stock solution of [Pd(dippf)(maleimide)] (1.24 mg, 0.002 mmol) and dippf (0.85 mg, 0.002 mmol) in toluene (2 mL) was injected through the septa caps with the aid of a syringe.

"All tests were carried out in 20 mL headspace vials for the gas chromatography, which vials were sealed with aluminum flange caps with teflon-coated butyl rubber septa (both available, for example, from VWR). To control the temperatures of the vessels, 8 cm-high cylindrical aluminum blocks were used, the diameter of which exactly corresponds to that of the hot plates of laboratory magnetic stirrers (e.g. Heidolph Mr 2002). These aluminum blocks were provided with ten 7 cm deep holes with the diameter of the reaction vessels and a hole for accommodating a temperature sensor.

"To enable the simultaneous evacuation and refilling of ten vessels, vacuum distributors were manufactured for connection to the Schlenk line. To this end, ten 3 mm vacuum-tight teflon hoses were respectively connected at one end to adapters to accommodate Luer Lock syringe needles and at the other end to a steel tube that can be connected to the Schlenk line via a vacuum hose.

"To carry out the tests, the first aryl bromide, X-B, (1.00 mmol), the corresponding primary amine, A-NH2, (1.00 mmol) and sodium-feat-butanolate (118 mg, 1.20 mmol) were weighed out in air into the reaction vessels, 20 mm magnetic stirring bars were added and the vessels were sealed airtight with septa caps using flanging pliers. 10 reaction vessels were respectively inserted into the holes of an aluminum block and connected to the vacuum distributor via cannulas, which were bored through the septa caps.

"The reaction vessels were then collectively evacuated and flushed with nitrogen three times in succession. After the reaction vessels were provided with an inert gas atmosphere in this way, a pressure equalization with the outside atmosphere was created in the vacuum line via the relief valve. A stock solution of [Pd(dippf)(maleimide)] (3.11 mg, 0.005 mmol) and dippf (2.13 mg, 0.005 mmol) in dry toluene (2 mL) was injected through the septa caps with the aid of a syringe. The aluminum block was then brought to 80° C. and the needles were removed from the vacuum distributor.

"After a reaction time of 20 h, the second aryl bromide, X-C, (1.10 mmol) in dry toluene (0.5 mL) was injected through the septa caps. The temperature was increased to 120° C., the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 hours and opened carefully after cooling to room temperature, and the reaction medium diluted with dichloromethane (30 mL) and water (30 mL). The aqueous phase was separated from the organic phase and extracted with dichloromethane (2×20 mL). The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed in vacuum (40° C., 500 mbar). The remaining raw product was cleaned using column chromatography (SiO2, ethyl acetate:hexane) and the corresponding tertiary amine thereby obtained.

"Unsymmetrically substituted dicarboxylic acid diamido ammonium salts and their use for gas hydrate anti-agglomeration
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"The present invention relates to a low dosage gas hydrate inhibitor which comprises at least one unsymmetrically substituted dicarboxylic acid diamido ammonium salt and a method for preventing, inhibiting, or otherwise modifying the agglomeration of gas hydrates by adding an effective amount of the inhibitor to a multiphase mixture comprising water, gas and, in some cases, condensate, black oil and/or drilling mud. The inhibitor effects improved anti-agglomeration of gas hydrates in petroleum fluids containing varying amounts of water/brine, crude oil/condensate, and natural gas as for example in crude hydrocarbon streams under conditions prone to the formation of gas hydrates. It is obtainable from renewable materials and has good biodegradability.

"A number of hydrocarbons, especially low molecular weight hydrocarbons with 1 to 6 carbon atoms are known to form hydrates. Hydrates may form in conjunction with water present in the system under a variety of conditions—particularly at the combination of lower temperature and higher pressure. In the oil and gas industry such conditions often prevail in formation fluids and in equipment containing natural gas. Usually gas hydrates are solids that are essentially insoluble in the fluid itself. Any solids, including hydrates, present in a formation or natural gas fluid are problematic for production, handling and transport of these fluids. The solid hydrates may cause plugging and/or blockage of pipelines, transfer lines and other conduits, of valves and/or safety devices and/or other equipment. This may result in shutdown, lost oil production, pipeline damage, risk of explosion or unintended release of hydrocarbons into the environment either on-land or off-shore. Therefore it poses a safety hazard to field workers and the public. The damage resulting from a blockage can be very costly from an equipment repair standpoint, as well as from the loss of production, and finally the resultant environmental impact. Accordingly, gas hydrates are of substantial interest as well as concern to many industries, particularly the petroleum and natural gas industry.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Gas hydrates are clathrates, and are also referred to as inclusion compounds. Clathrates are cage structures formed between a host molecule and a guest molecule. A gas hydrate generally is composed of crystals formed by water host molecules surrounding the hydrocarbon guest molecules. The smaller and lower-boiling hydrocarbon molecules, particularly C1- (methane) to C4 hydrocarbons and their mixtures, are especially problematic because their hydrate or clathrate crystals are easy to form. For instance, it is possible for ethane to form hydrates at as high as 4° C. at a pressure of about 1 MPa. If the pressure is about 3 MPa, ethane hydrates can form at as high a temperature as 14° C. Even certain non-hydrocarbons such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide are known to form hydrates under certain conditions. Thus, when the appropriate conditions are present, hydrates can be easily formed for example during the transportation of oil and gas in pipelines.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Modern oil and gas technologies tend to operate under increasingly severe conditions. For example, during the course of drilling operations as well as during oil recovery and production, high pumping speed, high pressure in the pipelines, extended length of pipelines, and low temperature of the oil and gas flowing through the pipelines, for example in subsea operations are applied. This increases the frequency of formation of gas hydrates.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"There are two basic techniques to overcome or control the gas hydrate problems, namely thermodynamic and kinetic. For the thermodynamic approach a number of methods have been reported, including water removal, increasing temperature, decreasing pressure, addition of “antifreeze” to the fluid and/or a combination of these (known in the industry as Thermodynamic Hydrate Inhibitors and abbreviated THI). The kinetic approach generally attempts to inhibit and/or retard initial gas hydrate crystal nucleation and/or further crystal growth (known in the industry as a Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitor and abbreviated KHI). Thermodynamic and kinetic hydrate control methods may be used in conjunction.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"The amount of chemical needed to prevent blockages varies widely depending upon the type of inhibitor employed. Thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors are substances that can reduce the temperature at which the hydrates form at a given pressure and water content. They are typically used at very high concentrations (regularly dosed as high as 50 wt.-% based on water content, with glycol often being used in amounts equal to the weight of water present in the system). Therefore, there is a substantial cost associated with the provision, transportation and storage of large quantities of these solvents. The use of kinetic hydrate inhibitors is a more cost-effective alternative as they generally require a dose of less than about 2 wt.-% based on the water content to inhibit the nucleation and/or growth of gas hydrates. Kinetic hydrate inhibitors are often also labeled Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (abbreviated LDHI).
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Besides the kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) there is a second general type of LDHIs, the so-called Anti-Agglomerants (abbreviated AA). While KHIs work by delaying the growth of gas hydrate crystals and may function as “anti-nucleators”, AAs allow hydrates to form but prevent them from agglomerating and subsequently from accumulating into larger aggregates capable of causing plugs. Often AAs prevent the once formed smaller gas hydrate crystals to adhere to the pipe wall.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Kinetic efforts to control hydrates have included the use of different chemicals as inhibitors. Typically, KHIs are low molecular weight polymers that adsorb on gas hydrate crystal faces and interfere with the nucleation and growth of gas hydrate crystals. For instance, polymers with lactam rings (stemming e.g. from vinyl caprolactam) have been employed to control clathrate hydrates in fluid systems. Similarly, onium compounds with at least four carbon substituents are used to inhibit the plugging of conduits by gas hydrates. Unfortunately, there are several limitations that have been discovered with the use of KHIs such as subcooling limits, solubility problems based on temperature and salt content of the water, and chemical incompatibility with the system being treated.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Anti-agglomerants typically are surface active molecules (amphiphiles). When small gas hydrate crystals begin to form, AAs attach to them via their polar headgroup. This makes the surface hydrophobic, which mediates the capillary attraction between the crystals and water and fosters dispersion of the crystals in a liquid hydrocarbon phase. This results in a relatively stable and transportable hydrate slurry in a liquid hydrocarbon phase that can flow to the processing facility. AAs are usually added at dose rates of less than 0.5 wt.-% and up to 2.0 wt.-% based on the water phase.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Besides some polymeric substances and especially nitrogen-containing polymers many different monomeric substances have been described to work as anti-agglomerant. Quaternary amine chemistry has been proven to be especially effective as anti-agglomerant for hydrate control. The best performing AAs are quaternary ammonium surfactants in which the ammonium headgroup has two or three butyl or pentyl groups attached to the quaternary nitrogen.

"However, due to their chemistry most of the anti-agglomerants are toxic and only a few of them are biodegradable. Many of the known anti-agglomerants show high potential for bioaccumulation. Due to their surface activity water quality and fluids separation upon application of quaternary ammonium surfactants are industrial-wide technical challenges, therefore thwarting its broad field implementation to replace conventional THI methods. Thus, it is desirable if new gas hydrate inhibitors were discovered which yield comparable or even improved results over known gas hydrate inhibitors. Improved AAs must reduce the agglomeration tendency of hydrates in conditions under which a hydrate may be formed. They should prevent gas hydrate agglomeration at least 10° C. and preferably 15° C. below the thermodynamic hydrate formation temperature, i.e. they have to allow a subcooling of 10° C., preferably 15° C. and more. Additionally they have to remain effective through long shut in periods (days to weeks or even months) at dose rates of about 0.5-3.0 wt.-%.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Furthermore, KHIs and even LDHIs are relatively expensive chemicals. Accordingly there is a constant strive for more efficient LDHIs which require lower dosage rates while maintaining effective hydrate inhibition and/or allowing for higher subcooling. Similarly there is an ambition for new synthetic routes for gas hydrate inhibitors having improved economics as well as an improved ecological footprint. In doing so the use of a high portion of renewable raw materials is desirable.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"An additional technical limitation of most anti-agglomerants is that they require a hydrocarbon phase (e.g. oil or gas condensate) to disperse the gas hydrate crystals. Thus, their application is often restricted to fluid systems prone to hydrate formation with oil contents of at least 50 vol.-% and preferably of at least 60 vol.-% and vice versa to lower water-cuts. In general, the water-cut should be below 80 vol.-%, and especially with brine having low salinity it should be below 60 vol.-% and preferably below 50 vol.-% of the fluid to be treated as otherwise the crystals cannot be dispersed and/or the slurry may become too viscous for transport.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for compositions and methods that effectively prevent agglomeration of gas hydrates especially in oil and gas transportation and handling processes. Particularly there is the need for anti-agglomerants which need lower dosage rates to maintain effective hydrate inhibition. This need is especially strong for the treatment of fluids with higher water-cuts, particularly of greater than 50 vol.-%. Furthermore, the synthesis of gas hydrate inhibitors should have a favorable ecological footprint and should be based on a high portion of renewable raw materials.

"To evaluate the performance of the presently disclosed N-alkyl-N′-(N″,N″-dialkylammoniumalkyl)dicarboxylic acid diamide salts (I) as low dose gas hydrate inhibitors, a rocking cell test was used. The rocking cell test is a commonly used test in the art for assessing the performance of anti-agglomerant chemistry. Briefly, additives are evaluated based on their ability to effectively minimize the size of hydrate particle agglomerates and then to disperse those particles into the hydrocarbon phase. The results were classified as “pass” or “fail” based on whether hydrate blockages were detected. Performance was evaluated by determining the minimum effective dose (MED) required to register as a “pass” in the rocking cell test. The effective dosages (MEDs) were screened for 5.0 wt % NaCl brine at 50 respectively 60 vol.-% watercut and 138 bar at 4° C.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"The rocking cell apparatus (“rack”) is comprised of a plurality of sapphire tubes, each placed within a stainless steel support cage. Each assembled sapphire tube and steel cage (hereby referred to as a rocking cell) is typically loaded with fluids containing a hydrocarbon fluid phase and a brine phase, along with a stainless steel ball for mixing. The rocking cell can withstand pressures of up to 200 bar (2900 psi). The rocking cell, once loaded with the fluids, is then mounted on the rack with gas injection and pressure monitoring. During testing, as the gases cooled and hydrates formed, the consumed gas was substituted via a high-pressure syringe pump to maintain the system at constant pressure.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"The rack was loaded with 10 rocking cells in a 2×5 configuration (two cells wide and 5 cells tall). The center position on the rack (between both cells) was fixed and allowed to rotate while the outer positions on the rack were moved vertically up and down. This vertical motion allowed the rocking cells to rotate into a positive or negative angle position. The steel ball placed inside the sapphire tube moved from one end of the cell to the other during a rocking motion. The rack rocked up and down at a rate of about 5 complete cycles (up and down) every minute. The rack was further contained within a temperature controlled bath attached to a chiller with temperature control from −10° C. to 60° C.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"The rocking cells were filled with three components: hydrocarbon, aqueous phase, and gas. First, each rocking sapphire tube was filled with 5 ml of dodecane and a 5 ml of 5% NaCl brine (watercut 50 vol.-%) respectively 4 ml of dodecane and 6 ml of 5% NaCl brine (watercut 60 vol.-%) for a total liquid loading of 50% total tube volume (20 mL total). The inhibitor was added as a 50 wt.-% active solution at dose rates in percent, by volume of water (vol.-%). Green Canyon gas was used for this testing with its composition given in Table 2.

"Rocking Cell Test Procedure:
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"A. Pretest Steps: Once the rack has been loaded with the rocking cells containing hydrocarbon fluid and brine, the rocking cells are evacuated with a vacuum pump for 15-20 minutes. While evacuating, the bath temperature is increased to the starting test temperature of 49° C. Once the bath has reached 49° C., the cells and the syringe pump are pressurized with Green Canyon gas to 138 bar and the syringe pump is switched on to maintain pressure during initial saturation. B. Saturation Step: The apparatus is set to rock at 5 rocks per minute for 2 hours to ensure the hydrocarbon fluids and brine loaded in the cell have been saturated with gas. This testing is performed at constant pressure and the syringe pump remains switched on and set at 138 bar for the remainder of the test. C: Cooling Step: While maintaining a rocking rate of 5 rocks per minute, the system is cooled from 49° C. to 4° C. over 6 hours. D. Steady State Mixing Step before Shut-in: At the constant temperature of 4° C., the apparatus is kept rocking at 5 rocks per minute for 12 hours to ensure complete hydrate formation. E. Shut-in Step: The apparatus is set to stop rocking and to set the cell position to horizontal and kept at a constant temperature of 4° C. for 12 hours. F. Steady State Mixing Step after Shut-in: At the conclusion of the shut in period, the apparatus is restarted at the rate of 5 rocks per minute at the constant temperature of 4° C. for 4 hours. G. Test Completion: At the conclusion of the experiment, the apparatus is set to stop rocking and the cells are set at a negative inclination to keep fluids away from the gas injection port. The chiller bath is set to 49° C. to melt any formed hydrates and allow for depressurization and cleaning.
",0,US20200109107A1.txt
"To determine the relative performance of each inhibitor or dose rate of inhibitor, visual observations were made during the shut in period and correlated with an interpretation of the time required for the ball within the cell to travel between two magnetic sensors. Each experiment was conducted in duplicate to confirm reproducibility. Table 2 below shows the results from some of the rocking cell tests.

"A nanocrystal referred to as a quantum dot (QD) is a material having a crystal structure of several nano to several tens of nano size, consists of hundreds to thousands of atoms, and has unique electrical, magnetic, optical, chemical and mechanical properties different from the unique properties of the original material itself, according to the unique crystal structure and particle size. And, by controlling the size of the nanocrystal, the above described properties can be controlled. Due to such properties, quantum dots are receiving great attention because they are highly likely to be applied for various devices such as next generation light emitting diodes (LED), organic/inorganic hybrid electroluminescent devices, inorganic electroluminescent devices, solar cells, transistors, etc.
",0,US20200140467A1.txt
"In order to secure excellent emission spectrum, a quantum dot is required to have high luminous efficiency and excellent color purity, wherein the color purity is evaluated as being excellent as full width at half maximum (FWHM) is narrower, and as the crystal size of a quantum dot is more uniform, namely, a quantum dot has a crystal of more uniform size, narrower full width at half maximum is exhibited.
",0,US20200140467A1.txt
"A quantum dot is receiving attention due to high luminous efficiency and color reproducibility compared to the existing light emitting material, and among them, quantum dots using Group II-VI compounds of the periodic table have high luminous efficiency and luminous region, and thus, a lot of studies are being progressed thereon.
",0,US20200140467A1.txt
"An InP quantum dot is a representative Group II-V quantum dot having a broad luminous region from visible ray to near infrared ray. However, in general, the InP quantum dot has somewhat low luminous efficiency and comparatively low color purity, compared to a CdSe-based quantum dot, and thus, a lot of studies for preparing an InP quantum dot having improved luminous efficiency have been progressed.
",0,US20200140467A1.txt
"The InP quantum dot is prepared by reacting a phosphorus precursor with an indium precursor, and as the phosphorus precursor, a phosphine compound, TMSP (tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine), is generally used.
",0,US20200140467A1.txt
"However, since TMSP has a high risk of explosion and contains lethal toxicity, and the InP quantum dot prepared from TMSP by known methods cannot be considered as exhibiting sufficiently competitive color purity, there is a demand for the development of a phosphorus precursor that can prepare a quantum dot having narrower full width at half maximum instead of TMSP, and has secured process stability.
",0,US20200140467A1.txt
"Korean Registered Patent No. 1043311 disclosed a method for preparing an InP quantum dot using tris(dimethyl tert-butyl)silyl phosphine (P(SiMe2-tert-Bu)3) as a phosphorus precursor instead of TMSP.
",0,US20200140467A1.txt
"However, since the tris(dimethyl tert-butyl)silyl phosphine, similarly to TMSP, has a tertiary phosphine structure wherein three identical ligands (dimethyl tert-butyl silyl group) are introduced in the central atom phosphorus(P), and does not have the effect of decreasing full width at half maximum compared to the quantum dot prepared using TMSP, it is not sufficient to replace TMSP, and there is a demand for a precursor capable of preparing a quantum dot with higher color purity.

"The abnormal expression of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) leads to cell proliferation disorder and is associated with tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. As a result, a variety of PTKs have been used as targets for screening anti-tumor drugs [Drake. J. M.; Lee, J. K.; Witte, O. N., Clinical targeting of mutated and wild-type protein tyrosine kinases in cancer. Molecular and cellular biology 2014, 34 (10), 1722-32].
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"Currently, all PTK inhibitors that are clinically available are those that occupy ATP pockets. Since ATP is a common cofactor that is inherently concentrated in cells (mM), large quantities of the inhibitor must be delivered to the ATP pockets to achieve adequate selectivity and affinity. A practical, though under-utilized approach, is to develop kinase inhibitors that bind to the substrate site. This approach should be appealing because each kinase is specific for a unique peptide sequence.

"The Src family of kinase enzymes (SFK) are non-receptor tyrosine kinases essential in signaling machinery [Guo, W.: Giancotti, F. G., Integrin signalling during tumour progression. Nature reviews Molecular cell biology 2004, 5 (10), 816]. Members of SFKs include Src, Yes, Fyn, Fgr, Lck, Hck, Blk, Yrk, and Lyn. SFKs are important for fundamental cellular processes such as cell growth, functions, survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration [Lieu, C.: Kopetz, S., The SRC family of protein tyrosine kinases: a new and promising target for colorectal cancer therapy. Clinical colorectal cancer 2010, 9 (2), 89-94]. Aberrant activities of SFK have been linked to a variety of cancers including those of the prostate, breast, colon, lungs, pancreas, brain, melanocytes, and bone marrow [Frame, M. C.; Roskoski, R., Src Family Tyrosine Kinases. In Reference Module in Life Sciences. Elsevier: 2017]. Inhibitors of Src kinase such as dasatinib, bosutinib, saracatinib, KX-01, and KX-02 have been recently developed for cancer treatment [Elsberger, B.: Stewart, B.; Tatarov, O.: Edwards, J., Is Src a viable target for treating solid tumours? Current cancer drug targets 2010, 10 (7), 683-694; Rothschild, S. I.: Gautschi, O.; Haura, E. B.; Johnson, F. M., Src inhibitors in lung cancer: current status and future directions.

Journal of medicinal chemistry 2018, 61 (11), 4704-4719, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety].

The described embodiments, together with further advantages, will be best understood by reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"Embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the disclosure are shown.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"As used herein, the words “a” and “an” and the like carry the meaning of “one or more”. Within the description of this disclosure, where a numerical limit or range is stated, the endpoints are included unless stated otherwise. Also, all values and subranges within a numerical limit or range are specifically included as if explicitly written out.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"As used herein, the terms “compound”, “starting material”, and “product” are used interchangeably, and are intended to refer to a chemical entity, whether in the solid, liquid or gaseous phase, and whether in a crude mixture or purified and isolated.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to a physical association of a compound of this disclosure with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. Solvate encompasses both solution phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvents include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, ethyl acetate and other lower alkanols, glycerine, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl acetate (DMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropyl ether, acetonitrile, toluene. N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetrahydropyran, other cyclic mono-, di- and tri-ethers, polyalkylene glycols (e.g. polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol), and mixtures thereof in suitable proportions. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, isopropanolates and mixtures thereof. Methods of solvation are generally known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"As used herein, the term “tautomer” refers to constitutional isomers of organic compounds that readily convert by tautomerization or tautomerism. The interconversion commonly results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom or proton, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and adjacent double bond. Tautomerism is a special case of structural isomerism, and because of the rapid interconversion, tautomers are generally considered to be the same chemical compound. In solutions in which tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors including, but not limited to, temperature, solvent and pH. Exemplary common tautomeric pairs include, but are not limited to, ketone and enol, enamine and imine, ketene and ynol, nitroso and oxime, amide and imidic acid, lactam and lactim (an amide and imidic tautomerism in heterocyclic rings), and open-chain and cyclic forms of an acetal or hemiacetal (e.g., in reducing sugars).
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"As used herein, the term “stereoisomer” refers to isomeric molecules that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (i.e. constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space. This contrasts with structural isomers, which share the same molecular formula, but the bond connection of their order differs. By definition, molecules that are stereoisomers of each other represent the same structural isomer. Enantiomers are two stereoisomers that are related to each other by reflection, they are non-superimposable mirror images. Every stereogenic center in one has the opposite configuration in the other. Two compounds that are enantiomers of each other have the same physical properties, except for the direction in which they rotate polarized light and how they interact with different optical isomers of other compounds. Diastereomers are stereoisomers not related through a reflection operation, they are not mirror images of each other. These include meso compounds, cis- and trans- (F- and Z-) isomers, and non-enantiomeric optical isomers. Diastereomers seldom have the same physical properties. In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers may refer to enantiomers, diastereomers, or both.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"Conformers, rotamers, or conformational isomerism refers to a form of isomerism that describes the phenomenon of molecules with the same structural formula but with different shapes due to rotations around one or more bonds. Different conformations can have different energies, can usually interconvert, and are very rarely isolatable. There are some molecules that can be isolated in several conformations. Atropisomers are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers. In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers may refer to conformers, atropisomers, or both.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers of the double bonds, ring systems, stereogenic centers, and the like can all be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present disclosure. Cis- and trans- (or E- and Z-) stereoisomers of the compounds of the present disclosure wherein rotation around the double bond is restricted, keeping the substituents fixed relative to each other, are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. S- and R- (or L- and D-) stereoisomers of the compounds of the present disclosure are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. All processes or methods used to prepare compounds of the present disclosure and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present disclosure. When stereoisomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography, fractional crystallization, or use of a chiral agent.
",0,US10844022B1.txt
"As used herein, the term “substituted” refers to at least one hydrogen atom that is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is noted as “optionally substituted”, the substituents are selected from halo, hydroxyl, alkoxy, oxo, alkanoyl, aryloxy, alkanoyloxy, amino, alkylamino, arylamino, arylalkylamino, disubstituted amines (e.g. in which the two amino substituents are selected from the exemplary group including, but not limited to, alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl), alkanoylamino, aroylamino, aralkanoylamino, substituted alkanoylamino, substituted arylamino, substituted aralkanoylamino, thiol, alkylthio, arylthio, arylalkylthio, alkylthiono, arylthiono, aryalkylthiono, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, arylalkylsulfonyl, sulfonamide (e.g. —SO2NH2), substituted sulfonamide, nitro, cyano, carboxy, unsubstituted amide (i.e. —CONH2), substituted amide (e.g. —CONHalkyl, —CONHaryl, —CONHarylalkyl or cases where there are two substituents on one nitrogen from alkyl, aryl, or alkylalkyl), alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, substituted aryl, guanidine, heterocyclyl (e.g. indolyl, imidazoyl, furyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, pyrrolidyl, pyridyl, pyrimidiyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, homopiperazinyl and the like), substituted heterocyclyl and mixtures thereof. The substituents may themselves be optionally substituted, and may be either unprotected, or protected as necessary, as known to those of ordinary skill in the art, for example, as taught in Greene, et al., “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons.

Caspase 3 belongs to the effector (caspase 3, 6 and 7) class of proteases and it is a key protease that is activated during early stages of apoptosis. Like other proteases, caspase 3 is present in the cell as inactive zymogens that can be activated through proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residue. The activated caspase 3 is a marker for cell apoptosis that proteolytically cleaves and activates other caspases and intracellular targets [Patel, T.; Gores. G. J.: Kaufmann, S.

Inhibition of Src kinase mediated activation of STAT3 leads to apoptosis in HL-60 cells [Zhao, W. et al., orafenib induces apoptosis in HL60 cells by inhibiting Src kinase-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation, Anti-Cancer Drugs 2011, 22, 1, p 79-88, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety]. We therefore performed apoptosis assay to detect caspase-3 activity (FIGS. 10A-G). Treatment of HL60 cells with 362.5 nM of KIM-161C demonstrate more than 2-fold increase in the cells undergoing apoptosis as compared to the basal apoptosis in HL-60 cells at both 24 and 48 h of treatment. Treatment of HL60 cells with 725 nM of KIM-161C demonstrated more than 9.5-fold and 8.45-fold increase in the cells undergoing apoptosis as compared to the basal apoptosis in HL-60 cells at both 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively.

"The present invention relates to the field of organic synthesis and catalysis. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of formamide compounds by using clamped transition metal complexes as catalysts to perform the reaction between carbon dioxide, hydrogen and an amine compound.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,US20180030009A1.txt
"Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that affects the environment as well as an inexhaustible, cheap, safe and renewable carbon resource. In recent years, how to provide useful chemistry and chemical engineering products by using carbon dioxide as a carbon resource has attracted wide concern of governments and scientists while in-depth study has been carried out.
",0,US20180030009A1.txt
"On the other hand, formamide compounds such as formamide, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-formylmorpholine are very important chemical raw materials, solvents and pharmaceutical intermediates in which DMF is referred to as “universal solvent” which can also be used in the petrochemical industry as a gas absorbent for the separation and refining of gas; in addition, N-formyl morpholine is also an important formamide compound has a wide range of applications in industry, which can be used as a solvent in organic synthesis as well as the best extraction solvent for the separation of aromatic hydrocarbons and paraffin hydrocarbons to produce benzene with high purity (99.99%).
",0,US20180030009A1.txt
"Commonly used methods to produce formamides in industry are formic acid method, methyl formate method, etc. The method for DMF is relatively special, which is mainly a carbon monoxide method, in which the main raw materials are synthesis ammonia, industrial methanol and carbon monoxide. At present, the raw materials for this method are of wide range of source, thus suitable for large-scale continuous production. Most of the large enterprises in United States, Japan and China use this method. However, in consideration of the large production and consumption of DMF, and the method based on non-renewable coal resources as raw material, the development of cleaner and reproducible production method is still necessary.
",0,US20180030009A1.txt
"DMF can also be synthesized from CO2 as raw material, and formic acid obtained by hydrogen reduction of CO2 reacts with dimethylamine and is dehydrated to give DMF. But the catalyst developed later is of low efficiency, of which TON is 3400. Until 1994, Prof. NOYORI found that DMF can be synthesised in the supercritical carbon dioxide with tetra (trimethylphosphine) dichloro ruthenium complex as a catalyst at high efficiency, of which TON reached 4.2 million, but the total pressure of the supercritical reaction system is up to 210 atmospheric pressure, not only leading to high energy consumption, but also harsh requirement to the equipment and materials, so that the catalytic system is not suitable for practical applications in the industry. At the same time, the method is of poor substrate applicability due to the different solubility of amine in the supercritical carbon dioxide. Only a few formamide compounds can be synthesized in this way, such as dimethylamine, diethylamine and propylamine. In 2012, Prof. Cantat reported that polysilicate reagent can be used to reduce CO2 and reacts with several primary amine and secondary amine to prepare DMF and other formamide compounds. However, this method requires the use of equivalent amounts of silicon reagent which is of high cost, and when the substrate is a primary amine, it is prone to be over reduced, and of poor reaction selectivity.
",0,US20180030009A1.txt
"Therefore, there is a need in the art for a new environmental friendly method for synthesizing formamide compounds which is of good substrate applicability, convenient use of catalyst, high production efficiency and suitable reaction conditions for industrial production, and low by-product pollution.

"Under an air atmosphere, ruthenium complex 1b (6.0 mg, 0.01 mmol), 5 mL of DMF and freshly prepared dimethylamine carbonate (abbreviated as: DIMCARB, comprising dimethylamine in a molar ratio of 2:1 to CO2, 35.2 g, 525 mmol dimethylamine). The air in the autoclave was replaced with carbon dioxide for three times, and then carbon dioxide and hydrogen were charged at 35 atm respectively, and the pressure was stably maintained at about 60 atm. After heated for 2.5 hours in a 120° C. oil bath, the pressure was reduced to 58 atmospheres. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature in a water bath to release the remaining gas in a fume hood, and then carbon dioxide and hydrogen was refilled at 35 atm respectively. The reactor was heated and stirred in an oil bath at 120° C. for another 2.5 hours, and the system pressure was reduced to 64 atm. The reactor was cooled to room temperature in a water bath, and then the remaining gas was slowly released in a fume hood to obtain faint yellow liquid. The obtained liquid was moved to a round bottom flask, distilled under reduced pressure (80° C., 3.1 torr) to give 33.74 g of a colorless liquid mixture of DMF and water (1H NMR analysis showed that the water content was usually between 7% to 16%, and the yield was calculated according to the water content of 20%). The remaining small amount of liquid in the round bottom flask was diluted with 5 ml of DMF and transferred to a 300 mL Parr autoclave again, then about 35 g of dimethylamine carbonate was added and the above procedure was repeated for the next round of dimethylformamide reaction. After the dimethylformylation reaction was cycled for 12 times, the catalytic effect was still well maintained (see Table 9).

"Molecular targeting treatment, which is a treatment method of performing treatment by using a certain molecule as a target and controlling its functions, is currently receiving attention widely. Such molecular targeting treatment targets a gene or a protein present on the surface of cells of a disease (e.g., cancer cells) and can thereby decrease the attack to normal cells by drugs so that adverse reactions can be reduced.

"The eukaryotic genomes constitute chromatin (chromosomes) and are thereby packed into the nucleus. The chromatin structure is formed by the repeat of nucleosome structures constituted by DNA and histones. In recent years, the chromatin has been found to be also deeply involved in a control mechanism called epigenetics (Non Patent Literature 1). The epigenetics refer to a control mechanism that regulates transcriptional activation, etc. by acquired modification without involving change in the sequence of DNA. Among others, modification in histones which are major proteins constituting the nucleosomes has significant influence on transcription and replication or repair.

Furthermore, PIP is under research as a drug for kidney damage, an anticancer agent, or a therapeutic drug for corneal trauma, hypertrophic scar, bone disease, and the like by animal experiments using mice. Also, PIP is an organic small molecule expected to produce various research achievements in such a way that the induction of iPS cells by PIP has been researched in recent years at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), which is the iPS cell project of the Kyoto University, as a part of research on iPS cells.

"The histone acetyltransferase (abbreviated to ""HAT"") of the present invention is an enzyme that highly acetylates histone proteins and participates in the activation of transcription. The histone acetylation adds negatively charged acetyl groups to histone proteins so that the histones are negatively charged to weaken the interaction between the histones and between DNA and the histones, thereby promoting dissociation. Therefore, nucleosome condensation is relaxed. It is considered that, as a result, condensation is also relaxed in a gene regulatory region to allow the binding of a transcription factor to the regulatory region, thereby promoting the expression of the gene.

Examples of the polyamide can include DNA-binding compounds such as pyrrole polyamide (PIP) (PIP compounds including a cyclic structure, a hairpin structure, and a tandem form in which hairpin structures are connected), peptide nucleic acid (PNA), bridged nucleic acid, locked nucleic acid (LNA), and complexes such as DNA-binding protein complexes (e.g., zinc finger).

"The ""pyrrole imidazole polyamide (referred to as PIP)"" of the present invention is a polyamide containing a N-methylpyrrole unit (Py), a N-methylimidazole unit (Im), and a γ-aminobutyric acid moiety, and Py, Im, and the γ-aminobutyric acid moiety are linked to each other via an amide bond (-C(=O)-NH-) (Trauger et al., Nature, 382, 559-61 (1996); White et al., Chem Biol., 4, 569-78 (1997); and Dervan, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 9, 2215-35 (2001)). PIP is wholly folded into a U-shaped conformation (hairpin form) by the γ-aminobutyric acid moiety serving as a linker (γ-linker). In the U-shaped conformation, two chains containing Py and Im are arranged in parallel, flanking the linker. When a pair of Py and Im between these two chains is a particular combination (Py/Im pair, Im/Py pair, Py/Py pair, or Im/Im pair), this pair can bind to a particular base pair in DNA with high affinity. For example, the Py/Im pair can bind to a C-G base pair, and the Im/Py pair can bind to a G-C base pair. Also, the Py/Py pair can bind to both an A-T base pair and a T-A base pair (White et al., Chem. Biol., 4, 569-78 (1997); and Dervan, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 9, 2215-35 (2001)). PIP may additionally contain 3-hydroxypyrrole (Hp) or β alanine. As for Hp, a Hp/Py pair can bind to a T-A base pair (White et al., Nature, 391, 468-71 (1998)). The γ-linker may have a side chain having an amino group, such as N-α-N-γ-aminobutyric acid and N-β-N-γ-aminobutyric acid, which may be modified with a molecule such as FITC or biotin. Also, PIP may be modified at its N terminus with not only an acetyl group but a molecule such as FITC or biotin. β alanine/β alanine can bind to a T-A base pair or an A-T base pair. Accordingly, PIP recognizing the regulatory region of the target gene can be designed by changing, for example, the pairing combination of Py and Im according to the DNA sequence of the target. A design method and a production method for PIP are known in the art (e.g., Japanese Patent No. 3045706, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-136974, WO03/000683, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2013-234135, and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2014-173032).

"The disadvantage of the production method by solid-phase reaction includes, because of using a CTB derivative having a carboxylic acid moiety in the step of solid-phase reaction, a larger amount necessary for synthesis than that in the production method by liquid-phase reaction. However, this does not impair the advantages of the production method by solid-phase reaction.

PIP was synthesized by the Fmoc solid-phase synthesis method from 43 mg of Fmoc-Py-oxime resin (approximately 0.42 mmol/g, 100-200 mesh). The reaction cycle is as follows: deprotection was performed twice (4 minutes each) using a DMF solution of 20% piperidine. Coupling was performed for 60 minutes using carboxylic acid, HCTU (88 mg), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (36 µL), and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Washing was performed five times (1 minute each) using DMF. Each coupling reagent per step was prepared as a NMP solution in the following amount: Fmoc-Py-COOH (77 mg), Fmoc-Im-COOH (77 mg), Fmoc-PyIm-COOH (70 mg), Fmoc-β-COOH (66 mg), Fmoc-γ-COOH (69 mg), and adipic acid (31 mg). All condensation steps were performed by single coupling, and stirring was performed by the bubbling of nitrogen gas. As a typical example, 40 mg of a resin and 1 mL of NMP were placed in a 2.5-mL plastic reaction vessel and left for 30 minutes to swell the resin. Fmoc monomers, HCTU, and 1 mL of NMP were added to a 2-mL plastic centrifugal tube and placed at positions according to a sequence. All lines were washed with NMP after solution transfer. After the completion of synthesis, the resin was washed with a 0.1 N NaOH solution, washed with water, then washed twice with 1 mL of DMF and twice with 1 mL of methanol, and dried under reduced pressure at room temperature in a desiccator.

By contrast, CTB-PIP-I and SAHA-PIP-I were found to activate the expression of similar pluripotency-related gene groups. The important point is that the specificity of the binding of PIP to DNA influenced genes to be elevated. As shown in Figure 3B, any gene common among 3 groups of SAHA, CTB, CTB-PIP, and SAHA-PIP was not observed in gene groups activated 5-fold or more.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,EP3290418A1.txt
"JAK belongs to a family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6. The present invention also provides methods for the production of the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, methods for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases involving inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6 by administering a compound of the present invention.

"Janus kinases (JAK) are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine signaling from membrane receptors to STAT transcription factors. Four JAK family members are described in the prior art: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, JAK family members auto- and/or transphosphorylate each other, followed by phosphorylation of STATs and then migrate to the nucleus to modulate transcription. JAK-STAT intracellular signal transduction is suitable for the interferons, most interleukins, as well as a variety of cytokines and endocrine factors such as EPO, TPO, GH, OSM, LIF, CNTF, GM-CSF and PRL (Vainchenker W. et al. (2008)).

"The combination of genetic models and small molecule JAK inhibitor research revealed the therapeutic potential of several JAKs. JAK2 gene mutation research is one of the breakthrough progress of hematological research in recent years. Myeloproliferative diseases (MPD) are disclosed in the prior art, including polycythemia vela (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and idiopathicmyelofibrosis (IMF), which are malignant diseases caused by the lesions of a group of hematopoietic stem cell lesion. A JAK2 point mutation (JAK2V617F) in this group of diseases was discovered by the researchers in 2005, which led to a new era in MPD diagnosis and treatment. JAK2V617 is a point mutation that occurs at exon v617 at exon 14, and valine (V) is substituted by phenylalanine (F). In the structure of JAK2, JH1 is the kinase domain; and Va1617 is located in JH2 adjacent to JH1, which is a pseudokinase domain, binds to JH1 and inhibits its activation. V617F mutations cause JH2 to lose inhibitory effect on JH1 kinase activity, leading to sustained activation of JAK2, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation [Kilpivaara 0, Levine RL. JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloprolifer-ative neoplasms: discovery and science. Leukemia. 2008; 22(10):1813-7]. There is a high incidence of JAK2V617F mutation in patients with polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. It was determined by Allele-Specific PCR that, the incidence of JAK2V617F mutation in patients with polycythaemia vera was 90%; in patients with essential thrombocythaemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis was 50%-60% [Baxter EJ, Scott LM, Campbell PJ, et al. Lancet. 2005; 365 (9464): 1054-61]. The molecular basis of these diseases without finding JAK2 mutation in patients lacking of V617F mutation is unclear. In 2007, an exon 12 mutation was found in JAK2V617F-negative MPD patients. This mutation can also cause JH2 to lose inhibitory effect on JH kinase activity, which provides molecular markers and genetic mechanisms for JAK2V617F-negative patients with myeloproliferative diseases[Scott LM, Tong W, Levine RL, et al. JAK2 exon 12 mutations in polycythemia vera and idiopathic erythrocytosis. NEngl J Med 2007;356:459-68·]. In normal physiological conditions, JAK2 mediates signal transduction of various cytokines, including erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin-3 and growth factor, and regulates and promotes cell proliferation. JAK2 gene plays an important role in adjustment of hematopoietic, and its downstream STAT family is a family of proteins that bind to DNA. The STAT family couples with JAK phosphorylated signaling pathway (JAK-STAT signaling pathway) and play a role in the regulation of transcription. JAK-STAT can directly correlate extracellular signals with gene expression regulation, initiate transcription and expression of responsive genes, complete the signal transduction process of cytokine receptors such as erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and thrombopoietin receptor (MPL/TPOR), resulting in cell proliferation effects.

"The MAPK/ERK signaling pathway relays extracellular stimuli to the nucleus, thereby regulating diverse cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. KRas protein is an initiator of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and functions as a switch responsible for inducing cell division. In its inactive state, KRas binds guanosine diphosphate (GDP), effectively sending a negative signal to suppress cell division. In response to an extracellular signal, KRas is allosterically activated allowing for nucleotide exchange of GDP for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). In its GTP-bound active state, KRas recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of growth factor induced signaling, as well as other cell signaling receptors. Examples of the proteins recruited by KRas-GTP are c-Raf and PI3-kinase. KRas, as a GTP-ase, converts the bound GTP back to GDP, thereby returning itself to an inactive state, and again propagating signals to suppress cell division, KRas gain of function mutations exhibit an increased degree of GTP binding and a decreased ability to convert GTP into GDP. The result is an increased MAPK/ERK signal which promotes cancerous cell growth. Missense mutations of KRas at codon 12 are the most common mutations and markedly diminish GTPase activity.
",0,US20200115375A1.txt
"Oncogenic KRas mutations have been identified in approximately 30% of human cancers, and demonstrated to activate multiple downstream signaling pathways. Despite the prevalence of KRas mutations, it has been a difficult therapeutic target. (Cox, A. D. Drugging the Undruggable RAS: Mission Possible? Nat. Rev.

"There remains a need to provide alternative, small molecule KRas inhibitors. In particular, there is a need to provide more potent, orally deliverable KRas inhibitors that are useful for treating cancer. More particularly, there is a need to provide small molecule inhibitors that specifically inhibit KRas GTP activity. There is also a need to provide small molecule KRas inhibitors that exhibit greater efficacy at the same or reduced KRas inhibitory activity. Further, there is a desire to provide KRas inhibitors that exhibit better pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. Also, there is a need to provide more potent KRas inhibitors that exhibit increased efficacy with reduced or minimized untoward effects. The present invention addresses one or more of these needs by providing novel KRas inhibitors.

"Obtain the XRPD patterns of crystalline solids on a Bruker D4 Endeavor X-ray powder diffractometer, equipped with a CuKα source and a Vantec detector, operating at 35 kV and 50 mA. Scan the sample between 4 and 40 2θ°, with a step size of 0.008 2θ° and a scan rate of 0.5 seconds/step, and using 1.0 mm divergence, 6.6 mm fixed anti-scatter, and 11.3 mm detector slits. Pack the dry powder on a quartz sample holder and a smooth surface is obtained using a glass slide. Collect the crystal form diffraction patterns at rt and relative humidity. Determine crystal peak positions in MDI-Jade after whole pattern shifting based on an internal NIST 675 standard with peaks at 8.853 and 26.774 2θ°. It is well known in the crystallography art that, for any given crystal form, the relative intensities of the diffraction peaks may vary due to preferred orientation resulting from factors such as crystal morphology and habit. Where the effects of preferred orientation are present, peak intensities are altered, but the characteristic peak positions of the polymorph are unchanged. See, e.g. The United States Pharmacopeia #23, National Formulary #18, pages 1843-1844, 1995. Furthermore, it is also well known in the crystallography art that for any given crystal form the angular peak positions may vary slightly. For example, peak positions can shift due to a variation in the temperature at which a sample is analyzed, sample displacement, or the presence or absence of an internal standard. In the present case, a peak position variability of ±0.2 2θ° is presumed to take into account these potential variations without hindering the unequivocal identification of the indicated crystal form. Confirmation of a crystal form may be made based on any unique combination of distinguishing peaks.

"This assay measures the ability of an inhibitor to compete with a probe for binding to and covalently modifying KRas G12C at codon 12. The signal is generated by the time-resolved transfer of fluorescence between europium on an antibody bound to KRas G12C Europium-labeled Anti-Histidine Tag Antibody LanthaScreen (the Eu Anti-His antibody) and fluorescent Tracer 647 (Alexa Fluor™) bound to KRas G12C through streptavidin and a biotinylated inhibitor (the “KRas Probe”, see Preparation 27).

"Inhibitors are tested in dose response format from 10 mM stocks in 100% DMSO. The Labycyte Echo® 555 is used to dilute and transfer 100 nL per well containing a 10 point, 2.8-fold serial dilution to an assay plate. Two copies of the assay plate are prepared to measure the potency after a 5 and 60 min incubation of the inhibitor with KRas G12C. His-tagged KRas G12C (20 nM) is added to the plates in assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% TX-100, and 1 mM DTT). After a 5 or 60 min incubation, 1 μM KRas Probe is added and allowed to covalently modify free KRas G12C for 1 hour. This is diluted 4-fold in buffer containing Eu Anti-His antibody and Streptavidin-Coated Tracer 647 (both from Life Technologies) to achieve KRas G12C (5 nM), Anti-His Antibody (2 nM), KRas Probe (300 nM), and Streptavidin Coated Tracer 647 (500 nM). After 30 min, the fluorescent signal is read on an Envision™ Plate Reader (excitation at 340 nM, tracer emission at 665 nM, and antibody emission at 615 nM). Maximum control wells lack inhibitor and minimum control wells lack both inhibitor and KRas G12C.

"To evaluate in vivo target inhibition and anti-tumor efficacy of a compound, Human lung cancer cells, H358 or H2122 are implanted into nude mice xenograft tumor models. Either H358 or H2122 cells (10×106 in a 1:1 Matrigel® mix, 0.2 mL total volume) are implanted by subcutaneous injection in hind leg of nude female mice (Harlan Laboratories). A total of 5 mice each group are used for efficacy study, and a total of 3-4 mice each group are used for target engagement and PD study. Treatment is initiated with oral administration (gavage) of a test compound or vehicle (20% Captisol®, 25 mM phosphate, pH 2.0 in 0.2 mL volume when the tumor size reaches approximately 300 mg. Tumor growth and body weight are monitored over time to evaluate efficacy and signs of toxicity. Bidimensional measurements of tumors are performed twice a week and tumor volumes are calculated based on mid-axis length and mid-axis width. Tumor volume data are transformed to a log scale to equalize variance across time and treatment groups. The log volume data are analyzed with a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance by time and treatment using the mixed procedures in SAS software (version 8.2). The correlation model for the repeated measures is spatial power. Treated groups are compared to the control group at each time point. The mixed procedure is also used separately for each treatment group to calculate adjusted means and standard errors at each time point. Both analyses account for the autocorrelation within each animal. The adjusted means and standard errors are plotted for each treatment group versus time.

Protein estimation is done on the lysate supernatant using a BioRad Dc® protein assay and lysates are diluted in complete lysis/binding buffer from the Ras GTPase Chemi ELISA Kit® (Active Motif, cat. no. 52097). The active KRas ELISA was performed as follows: Glutathione-coated ELISA wells were incubated with diluted RAF1-GST in complete lysis/binding buffer for 1 hr at 4° C. with gentle agitation. Wells are washed 3 times with wash buffer and 100 μg of lysates are added to each well and incubated at RT for 1 hr with mild agitation. The wells are washed an additional 3 times, then primary antibody, diluted in antibody binding buffer, is added to each well. The plates are incubated for 1 hr. The wells are washed 3 more times before adding HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted in antibody binding buffer, to each well. The plates are incubated at RT for 1 hr. ELISA wells are washed 4 times, chemiluminescent reagents is added and then luminescence is read. For pERK Meso Scale Discovery ELISA, 25 μg of protein containing 0.1% SDS is used; for pMEK Meso Scale Discovery ELISA, 50 μg of protein without SDS is used.

"Combination Efficacy with CDK4 and CDK6 Inhibitor Abemaciclib, EGFR Small Molecule Inhinitors or EGFR Monoclonal Antibody Cetuximab

"In addition to monotherapy, compound Example 1 is accessed for its combination efficacy with other targeted therapies, such as CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor abemaciclib, EGFR small molecule inhibitor erlotinib and EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. Cell lines for this study are obtained from ATCC and grown under ATCC recommended conditions, except for LXFA-983L, which is obtained from Oncotest/Charles Rivers Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass. and D122-96, which is obtained from L. Eisenbach (Weizman Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel)—both grown under recommended conditions. All cell lines have a KRAS G12C mutation. The proliferation assay is performed as a 4 day growth assay using Cell TiterGlo® as the readout. Briefly, cells are plated in 96-well cell culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight at 37° C. The following day, cells are treated with compounds, either single treatments or combination treatments. First, the testing compounds are serially diluted in DMSO, followed by dilution into media as a 5× concentration with 1% DMSO, and finally added to cells in media to dilute to 1×. The cells are incubated at 37° C. for 4 more days. At the end of the incubation period, Cell TiterGlo® reagent is mixed and added to the wells. After 10 minutes, the luminescence is read by a Perkin Elmer Envision instrument. Absolute IC50 values generated by a 4-parameter logistics model for the single and combination treatments are generated, followed by combination indexes for each combination treatment and cell line. The combination IC50 values are adjusted based on the total concentration of each compound when added together. (Example: for a 1:1 concentration ratio of compound 1 and compound 2, the combination IC50 is increased by a factor of 2). The combination index (CI) measures the degree to which the potency of a combination therapy differs from the expected-if-additive potency and is based on the Loewe definition of additivity.

"A mouse syngeneic model is used to evaluate the effects of KRas G12C inhibition and immuno-therapy combination. In this model, the KRas G12D mutation is converted to KRas G12C mutation by CRISPR knock-in in the CT-26 cell line, a mouse colorectal tumor cell line. The KRas G12C knock-in is confirmed by genetic and functional characterization. The engineered cell line is named CT-26-H4/KRas G12C. These cells are implanted to the Balb/c mice, and the compound treatment is started 6 days post tumor cell implantation. In this study, Example 1 is combined with either anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibody with the dose schedule listed in Table 18. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are known in the art and include durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab. As shown in Table 16, Example 1 demonstrates significant single agent activity with an average of 96% tumor growth inhibition and 10% (1 out of 10 animals) complete response (CR) at the end of 3 week dose. Anti-PD-L1 antibody shows 38% tumor growth inhibition with no complete response, and anti-PD-1 antibody shows 82% tumor growth inhibition and 10% complete response. However, combination of Example 1 with either anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibody achieves significantly better anti-tumor activity. At the end of 3 week dose, the combination with PD-L1 or PD-1 shows −56% and −51% tumor regression, and 80% and 89% complete response, respectively. After 3 weeks, compound treatment is stopped and all tumors in monotherapy groups with the exception of 1 animal in the anti-PD-1 group started to regrow. However, the tumors in the two combination groups have no signs of regrowth. 40 days post last dose, the combination groups maintain 80 and 89% complete response, indicating that the tumors in the combination groups are eliminated. These results suggest that Example 1 combination with either anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibody may have significant benefit for cancer patients with KRas G12C mutation.

"Several Michael acceptors (MAs) have been developed or are currently being developed as therapeutic agents. For instance, Afatinib (FIG. 1A) a target-specific MA selectively inhibits mutated HER2 kinase, and is approved by the FDA for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. See Minkovsky, N.; Berezov, A., BIBW-2992, a dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of solid tumors. Curr Opin Investig Drugs 2008, 9 (12), 1336-46; and Suzawa, K.; Toyooka, S.; Sakaguchi, M.; Morita, M.; Yamamoto, H.; Tomida, S.; Ohtsuka, T.; Watanabe, M.; Hashida, S.; Maki, Y.; Soh, J.; Asano, H.; Tsukuda, K.; Miyoshi, S., Antitumor effect of afatinib, as a HER2-targeted therapy, in lung cancers harboring HER2 oncogene alterations.

Other examples include ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) and neratinib (HER-2 inhibitor) that have been developed for B-cell cancers and solid tumors, respectively. See Singh, J.; Petter, R. C.; Baillie, T. A.; Whiny, A., The resurgence of covalent drugs. Nat Rev Drug Discov 2011, 10 (4), 307-17; and Lanning, B. R.; Whitby, L. R.; Dix, M. M.; Douhan, J.; Gilbert, A. M.; Hat, E. C.; Johnson, T.

F., A road map to evaluate the proteome-wide selectivity of covalent kinase inhibitors. Nat Chem Biol 2014, 10 (9), 760-7, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Mechanistically, the MAs cause cancer cell apoptosis by increasing the oxidative stress inside these cells. The cellular prooxidant induction by MAs is attributed to ligation of SH groups of certain targets involved in regeneration of reduced glutathione (GSH). This results in accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause cancer cell cycle exits and apoptosis. See Wondrak, G. T., Redox-directed cancer therapeutics: molecular mechanisms and opportunities. Antioxid Redox Signal 2009, 11 (12), 3013-69, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

"Acrolein (FIG. 1A) is a highly reactive and non-selective MA toxin and environmental pollutant with well-known carcinogenic activity. Interestingly, acrolein is also known to cause inhibition of the β-subunit of the proliferative anti-apoptotic protein NFκB via covalent binding with the nucleophilic Cys-61 and Arg-307 leading to cytotoxicity and cell death of cancer cells. See Chan, K.; Poon, R.; O'Brien, P. J., Application of structure-activity relationships to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatocyte toxicity and electrophilic reactivity of alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes. J Appl Toxicol 2008, 28 (8), 1027-39, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Thus despite its apparent toxic effect, acrolein like other MAs has potential as a therapeutic agent. Replacement of the aldehyde group of acrolein with an amide group (acrylamide moiety) is known to attenuate the reactivity of the MA moiety leading to less toxic compounds. See Schwobel, J. A.; Wondrousch, D.; Koleva, Y. K.; Madden, J. C.; Cronin, M. T.; Schuurmann, G., Prediction of michael-type acceptor reactivity toward glutathione. Chem Res Toxicol 2010, 23 (10), 1576-85, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Safe natural MA products that are common in domestic condiments, such as trans-cinnamaldehyde (tCA) and curcumin (FIG. 1), are known to cause cancer cell death via redox mechanisms. See Wondrak, G.

"Definitions
",0,US10836736B1.txt
"As used herein, the terms “compound”, “complex”, and “product” are used interchangeably, and are intended to refer to a chemical entity, whether in the solid, liquid or gaseous phase, and whether in a crude mixture or purified and isolated.
",0,US10836736B1.txt
"Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all stereo and optical isomers and racemates thereof where such isomers exist. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms are within the scope of the disclosure. Many geometric isomers of C═C double bonds, C═N double bonds, ring systems, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present disclosure. Cis- and trans- (or E- and Z-) geometric isomers of the compounds of the present disclosure are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Optically active forms may be prepared by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present disclosure and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present disclosure. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography, fractional crystallization, or through the use of a chiral agent. Depending on the process conditions the end products of the present disclosure are obtained either in free (neutral) or salt form. Both the free form and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the disclosure. If so desired, one form of a compound may be converted into another form. A free base or acid may be converted into a salt; a salt may be converted into the free compound or another salt; a mixture of isomeric compounds of the present disclosure may be separated into the individual isomers. Compounds of the present disclosure, free form and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged. It should be understood that all tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the disclosure. Further, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all conformers, rotamers, or conformational isomers thereof where such isomers exist. Different conformations can have different energies, can usually interconvert, and are very rarely isolatable. There are some molecules that can be isolated in several conformations. For example, atropisomers are isomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers. It should be understood that all conformers, rotamers, or conformational isomer forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the present disclosure.
",0,US10836736B1.txt
"As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to a physical association of a compound of this disclosure with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. Solvate encompasses both solution phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvents include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, ethyl acetate and other lower alkanols, glycerine, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl acetate (DMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropyl ether, acetonitrile, toluene, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetrahydropyran, other cyclic mono-, di- and tri-ethers, polyalkylene glycols (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol), and mixtures thereof in suitable proportions. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, isopropanolates and mixtures thereof.

"As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present disclosure can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred.

In this scheme, non-commercially available cinnamic acid analogues 2 were prepared by condensation of the corresponding aldehyde (1, R1CHO) with malonic acid.

After conversion to the cinnamoylglycine analogs (3), cyclocondensation was affected by their reaction with the corresponding aldehydes (R2CHO) to afford the 2-arylvinyl-4-benzylidene-5-oxazolinone derivatives (azlactones, 4) under Erlenmeyer conditions. The key azlactone intermediate 4 was subsequently reacted with a variety of aliphatic and aromatic amines to furnish the final compounds (FIG. 2 and Table 1). Generally, the aliphatic and benzylic amines reacted with the azlactone smoothly at room temperature in ethanol. The less reactive aromatic amines needed microwave heating in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent.

The subset of compounds (Codes MOS-1503 to 1559), having fixed phenyl groups at R1 and R2 positions (FIG. 2), demonstrated moderate to weak antiproliferative activities (Table 1). However, it was clear that compounds bearing hydrophobic aliphatic groups such as MOS-1505 and MOS-1512 are clearly favored in providing anticancer activities. Compounds having non-polar groups on R3 position were more potent than those having polar groups such as MOS-1511, MOS-1532, MOS-1536. The N-aryl substituents were less advantageous in both potency and solubility. To zoom on N-aliphatic compounds, we observed that MOS-1505 N-(1-adamantyl) in this subset was the analogue with IC50=14.7±0.3 μM against HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. Unfortunately, MOS-1505 had poor solubility (ClogP 6.08). Meanwhile, compound 1512 was slightly less active (IC50=32.0±2.6 μM) but showed a better solubility profile (CLogP 4.48).

"[Background Art]
",0,EP3266765A1.txt
"Usually, proteins are each folded to form the specific native structure thereof, thereby exerting biological functions. When the proteins are misfolded, however, they may aggregate to form β-sheet-rich fibers (i.e., to form amyloid). Aggregates (e.g., oligomers, proto-fibrils, fibers) produced through this amyloid formation are known to cause various dysfunctions (these disorders are generally referred to as ""amyloid diseases""). Here, 20 or more proteins have been identified as substances responsible for the amyloid diseases. Example of such amyloid known include: amyloid β, tau protein in Alzheimer's disease; α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease; amylin in diabetes mellitus; transthyretin in systemic amyloidosis; and huntingtin in Huntington's disease.
",0,EP3266765A1.txt
"For example, as for amyloid β (abbreviated to Aβ), which is a causative amyloid of Alzheimer's disease, inhibitors of enzymes mediating the production of Aβ from a precursor protein, promoters of Aβ-degrading enzymes, immunotherapy, Aβ aggregation inhibitors, and the like are known as strategies to develop therapeutic drugs targeting these pathogenic amyloids.
",0,EP3266765A1.txt
"On the other hand, it has been reported as to Aβ that a Met-oxidized form of an Aβ peptide (the sulfur atom of the Met residue is oxidized to sulfoxide (-S=O-)) remains in a small amount in vivo, and the Met-oxidized form is less aggregable as compared with the native Aβ peptide (Non Patent Literatures 1 to 3). From these viewpoints, the present inventors reported that oxidized forms of Aβ peptides are obtained by the oxidation of the Aβ peptides using a flavin photocatalyst having an Aβ-binding site represented by the formula (a), and these oxidized forms of Aβ peptides suppress the aggregation of Aβ (Non Patent Literature 4).<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img>

"Next, a methanol solution containing each of compounds 2 to 4 was irradiated with light of 500 nm, and incubated at 37°C. Then, a change in the time course of the absorbance at the maximum light absorption wavelength was measured to compare their photostability (Figure 2). Compound 2 resulted in substantial photofading after about 30 min. By contrast, compounds 3 and 4, having a perfluoroalkyl group, took 2 hours or longer until complete photofading. That is, it was suggested that the present compounds having a perfluoroalkyl group on the boron atom should be more significantly stable against light than the compound having two fluorine atoms on the boron atom. Reaction with singlet oxygen seems to be primarily responsible for the photofading under visible light irradiation. So, the photostability of the present compounds was considered from the viewpoint of the reactivity with singlet oxygen. First, the HOMO/LUMO levels of compounds 2 to 4 were calculated in accordance with a DFT algorithm (Figure 3). The calculation results demonstrated that the HOMO/LUMO levels decreased in the order of F > CF3 > C2F5, which were a substituent on the boron atom. As the HOMO level increases, the compounds are more susceptible to oxygenation by singlet oxygen. Thus, this calculation results agree with the results of the photostability test. In addition, the three compounds exhibited almost no difference with respect to the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. This reflects the fact that the maximum absorption wavelength is unchanged.

"Each absorption spectrum was measured (Table 2).The maximum absorption wavelength of compound 8, in which the dimethylamino phenyl group of compound 9 was changed to a julolidine group, was shifted to the long-wavelength side by 30 nm than that of compound 9. Even when the substituent on the boron atom was changed from F to CF3 (compound 11), there was almost no observable change in the maximum absorption wavelength. The maximum absorption wavelength of compound 12, in which R6 was iodine, was shifted to the long-wavelength side by 20 nm. This allowed the compound to be efficiently excited by light with a longer wavelength of over 650 nm. In the cases of the carboxyl group- or sulfonic acid group-substituted tetrahydroquinoline derivatives (compounds 13 to 16) so as to introduce a water-soluble substituent, the absorption wavelength was shifted to the short-wavelength side by about 10 nm than that of the julolidine-substituted derivative. It can be deduced from the above results that as the lone electron pair of the nitrogen atom is arranged more stably on the same plane as that of the benzene ring due to the condensed ring structure of the julolidine or tetrahydroquinoline, the absorption wavelength tends to be shifted more to the long-wavelength side. Also, it was found that introduction of iodine caused a shift to the long-wavelength side and that the substituent on the boron atom did not significantly affect the absorption wavelength.

"(1) To check whether or not the compounds synthesized actually had Aβ oxygenation activity, in vitro oxygenation experiments were carried out using Aβ1-42 as a substrate. Compound 12 (20 µM) was added to a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), and the mixture was incubated at 37°C under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 595 nm). Then, a mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to follow the reaction. Before the light irradiation, native Aβ1-42 and Na+ adducts were primarily observed. After the light irradiation, however, there appeared ion peaks indicating the presence of oxygen adducts in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4).(2) The Aβ1-42 oxygenation activities of compounds 8, 11, and 12 were compared (Figure 5). First, 0.1% TFA aqueous solution containing o-acyliso-Aβ1-42 was diluted with a phosphate buffer solution (PB) (10 mM, pH 7.4) to prepare a native Aβ1-42 solution. To the resulting solution was added a DMSO catalyst stock solution (1.0 M). While incubated at 37°C, the mixture was irradiated with light at 595 nm. The MALDI-TOF MS results demonstrated that compounds 8, 11, and 12 each helped oxygenate Aβ1-42 under the light irradiation. The rate of oxygenation of Aβ1-42 was significantly faster using compound 12 than compounds 8 and 11 free of a heavy atom such as a bromine atom or an iodine atom. The heavy metal effect seems to enhance the efficiency of generating singlet oxygen. In addition, when comparing the compound 8 and 11, the compound 11 having a boron-trifluoromethyl bond had a faster oxygenation rate than the compounds 8, suggesting that the compound 11 can function as a better Aβ oxygenation catalyst.(3) Next, the activities of compounds 12, 14, and 16 were compared (Figure 6). Here, in view of application to multi-component systems such as cells, oxygenation experiments were carried out using DMEM as a solvent. O-acyliso-Aβ1-42 was converted to native Aβ1-42 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 hours to promote aggregation. Then, the resultant was mixed in DMEM. Because the compounds 12, 14, and 16 had a maximum absorption wavelength of more than 650 nm, the reaction was made to proceed by irradiation with light at 660 nm, which was a longer wavelength than that of the preceding experiments. The results demonstrated that the Aβ1-42 oxygenation activity of each of the compounds 14 and 16, in which a water-soluble substituent (i.e., a carboxyl group or a sulfonic acid group) was introduced, was significantly larger than that of the compound 12. The oxygenation activity of the compound 16 having a sulfonic acid site was higher than that of the compound 14 having a carboxylic acid site, indicating the tendency that the higher the water solubility, the higher the oxygenation activity. In addition, Figure 7 shows the Aβ1-42 oxygenation activity of compound 19. (4) To obtain more direct knowledge, compounds 13 to 15 were used to further investigate the functions of an oxygenation photocatalyst having a perfluoroalkyl group on the boron atom. First, the Aβ1-42 oxygenation activities of the compounds 13 to 15 were likewise compared (Figure 8). The results demonstrated that the oxygenation activity was significantly higher in the order of C2F5 > CF3 > F, which were a substituent on the boron atom. This result agrees with the order of the above-described photostability. Accordingly, the level of the catalyst stability is deemed to reflect the activity.

"Compound 14 was used to investigate whether or not a compound of the present invention was able to selectively oxygenate Aβ. First, compound 14 (20 µM) was added to phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) each containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), angiotensin IV (20 µM) or a methionine enkephalin (20 µM), which solutions had been preincubated for 3 hours. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 595 nm). Then, a mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to follow the reaction. Three model peptides having a residue capable of being oxygenated were selected, including angiotensin IV (AT-4), met-enkephalin (ME), and somatostatin (Sat). These three peptides were subjected to the same oxygenation conditions as for Aβ1-42 (Figure 9). In addition, riboflavin was used as a control which exhibited no Aβ selectivity, and the oxygenation experiments were likewise conducted. The results demonstrated that riboflavin exerted a certain oxygenation activity on all the peptides; by contrast, the compound 14 exerted strong oxygenation activity only toward Aβ1-42; and the oxygenation of each of the other peptides did not proceed at all or was significantly slower than that of Aβ1-42.

"In the following, in order to check whether or not compound 14 recognized a cross-β-sheet structure characteristic of Aβ aggregates to elicit oxygenation activity, dependency of the oxygenation rate on aggregation was examined. An incubation time after o-acyliso-Aβ1-42 was converted to native Aβ1-42 was used as an index for aggregation process index to check whether or not the oxygenation rate changed depending on the incubation time (Figure 10). A test compound (each 2 µM) was added to a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), which solution had not been incubated, or phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) each containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), which solutions had been preincubated for 1 or 3 hours. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 10 min under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 595 nm). Then, a mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to follow the reaction. The results demonstrated that the longer the incubation time, the faster the oxygenation of Aβ1-42. That is, it was found that the richer the cross-β-sheet structure as a result of aggregation, the faster the oxygenation of Aβ1-42. The above has indicated that the compound 14 recognizes the cross-β-sheet structure to selectively oxygenate aggregated Aβ.

"Aβ (40 µM) was dissolved in a phosphate buffer solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Next, compound 16 was added thereto (at 1.6 µM). Then, 0.1% horse serum-containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium was added to rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (purchased from RIKEN, Japan) seeded on a poly D-lysine-coated 96-well plate to prepare a mixture. To the mixture was added 25 µL of the above phosphate buffer solution containing Aβ and compound 16 (the final volume: 100 µL; the final Aβ concentration: 10 µM; the final compound 16 concentration: 0.4 µM). After that, this mixed solution was incubated at 37°C for 5 min under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 660 nm; at 10 mW) (provided that in the dark, no light irradiation). The plate containing the cell reaction solution was further incubated at 37°C for 48 hours under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Finally, a viable-cell count reagent SF containing WST-8 (10 µL; purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) was added and the resulting mixture was incubated at 37°C for 3 hours under 5% CO2 atmosphere to measure absorbance at 450 nm (cf., a reference wavelength: 655 nm). From the absorbance, cell viability was determined.

"Whether or not the oxygenation of Aβ1-42 in the presence of cells caused a decrease in cytotoxicity was investigated. Rat adrenal pheochromocytoma model nerve cells PC12 were used as cells and compound 16 with excellent water solubility and oxygenation activity was used as a catalyst to perform a cell viability (Figure 11). The cell viability was determined by measuring absorbance at 450 nm due to WST-8 using a plate reader. When Aβ1-42 and compound 16 were added under no light irradiation, substantially the same level of significant cell death as in the case where only Aβ1-42 was added was observed. By contrast, the cell viability under light irradiation significantly increased. That is, it has been demonstrated that the selective oxygenation of Aβ1-42 by the catalyst causes a decrease in cytotoxicity.

"The present compound represented by formula (1A) has a structure in which an electron donor site and an electron acceptor site rotate around a bond therebetween as a shaft. Even when excited by light in the absence of Aβ, the present compound causes no reaction because of the rotation and resultant relaxation. By contrast, when the compound binds to the higher structure of amyloid and the rotation is inhibited, an oxygenation reaction occurs through the production of singlet oxygen. It is considered that since the activity of the present compound is switchable as describe above, the present compound seems can oxygenate Aβ1-42 in a highly selectable manner even in a complicated system, for example in the presence of cells.",0,EP3266765A1.txt

"In their application, crop protection agents known to date for the selective control of harmful plants in crops of useful plants or active compounds for controlling unwanted vegetation sometimes have disadvantages, be it (a) that they have no or else insufficient herbicidal activity against particular harmful plants, (b) that the spectrum of harmful plants which can be controlled with an active compound is not wide enough, (c) that their selectivity in crops of useful plants is too low and/or (d) that they have a toxicologically unfavorable profile. Furthermore, some active compounds which can be used as plant growth regulators for a number of useful plants cause unwanted reduced harvest yields in other useful plants or are not compatible with the crop plant, or only within a narrow application rate range. Some of the known active compounds cannot be produced economically on an industrial scale owing to precursors and reagents which are difficult to obtain, or they have only insufficient chemical stabilities.

The suspension was stirred at boiling temperature for one hour, which gave a clear yellowish solution. The solvent was evaporated, and 5 ml of tetrahydrofuran were added to the residue. The solution thus obtained was then added dropwise to a solution of 161 mg of 3-chloroaniline and 141 mg of potassium tert-butoxide in 5 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was for 16 hours at room temperature, then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, taken up in water and extracted with ethyl acetate.

"The 1H NMR data of selected examples are noted in the form of 1H NMR peak lists. For each signal peak, first the δ value in ppm and then the signal intensity in round brackets are listed. The δ value—signal intensity number pairs for different signal peaks are listed with separation from one another by semicolons.
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"The peak list for one example therefore takes the form of:

",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"The intensity of sharp signals correlates with the height of the signals in a printed example of an NMR spectrum in cm and shows the true ratios of the signal intensities. In the case of broad signals, several peaks or the middle of the signal and the relative intensity thereof may be shown in comparison to the most intense signal in the spectrum.
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"For calibration of the chemical shift of 1H NMR spectra we use tetramethylsilane and/or the chemical shift of the solvent, particularly in the case of spectra measured in DMSO. Therefore, the tetramethylsilane peak may but need not occur in NMR peak lists.
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"The lists of the 1H NMR peaks are similar to the conventional 1H NMR printouts and thus usually contain all peaks listed in a conventional NMR interpretation.
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"In addition, like conventional 1H NMR printouts, they may show solvent signals, signals of stereoisomers of the target compounds, which likewise form part of the subject matter of the invention, and/or peaks of impurities.
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"In the reporting of compound signals in the delta range of solvents and/or water, our lists of 1H NMR peaks show the usual solvent peaks, for example peaks of DMSO in DMSO-D6 and the peak of water, which usually have a high intensity on average.
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"The peaks of stereoisomers of the target compounds and/or peaks of impurities usually have a lower intensity on average than the peaks of the target compounds (for example with a purity of >90%).
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"Such stereoisomers and/or impurities may be typical of the particular preparation process. Their peaks can thus help in identifying reproduction of our preparation process with reference to “by-product fingerprints”.
",0,US20200172491A1.txt
"An expert calculating the peaks of the target compounds by known methods (MestreC, ACD simulation, but also with empirically evaluated expected values) can, if required, isolate the peaks of the target compounds, optionally using additional intensity filters. This isolation would be similar to the relevant peak picking in conventional 1H NMR interpretation.

"Of particular interest is the selective control of harmful plants in crops of useful plants and ornamentals. Although the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention have already demonstrated very good to adequate selectivity in a large number of crops, in principle, in some crops and in particular also in the case of mixtures with other, less selective herbicides, phytotoxicities on the crop plants may occur. In this connection, combinations of inventive compounds of the general formula (I) that are of particular interest are those which comprise the compounds of the general formula (I) or their combinations with other herbicides or pesticides and safeners. The safeners, which are used in an antidotically effective amount, reduce the phytotoxic side effects of the herbicides/pesticides employed, for example in economically important crops, such as cereals (wheat, barley, rye, corn, rice, millet), sugarbeet, sugarcane, oilseed rape, cotton and soybeans, preferably cereals.

"Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed plants and crop plants were placed in plastic or wood-fiber pots and covered with soil. The compounds of the invention, formulated in the form of wettable powders (WP) or as emulsion concentrates (EC), were then applied to the surface of the covering soil as aqueous suspension or emulsion with addition of 0.5% additive at a water application rate equivalent to 600 l/ha. After the treatment, the pots were placed in a greenhouse and kept under good growth conditions for the test plants. After about 3 weeks, the effect of the preparations is scored visually in comparison with untreated controls as percentages. For example, 100% activity=the plants have died, 0% activity=like control plants.

"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) is a 40 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein. PD-L1 is expressed on a variety of cell types, including placenta, vascular endothelium, pancreatic islet cells, muscle, hepatocytes, epithelium, and mesenchymal stem cells, as well as on B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells. Interaction of PD-L1 with programmed death receptor (PD-1; also known as CD279) expressed on T cells (particularly on activated T cells) results in reduced T-cell proliferation and cytokine expression to help control local inflammatory responses and maintain self-tolerance. Tumor cells have co-opted the PD-1/PD-L1 regulatory mechanism to avoid immunologic surveillance, facilitating cancer growth.

"Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction would restore the function of chronically exhausted tumor-specific T cells and decrease tumor-induced immune suppression.
",0,US20180065917A1.txt
"General examples of PD-L1 antagonists or inhibitors include an antibody or antigen-binding fragment or small molecule that specifically binds to PD-L1 and reduces one or more of its immune-suppressive activities, for example, its binding to the PD-1 receptor. Specific examples of PD-L1 antagonists include the antibodies atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), avelumab (MSB0010718C), and durvalumab (MEDI4736), and antigen-binding fragments thereof.

"However, there remains a significant need for compounds that effectively and specifically inhibit the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 in a clinical setting, as well as for associated compositions and methods. The present invention satisfies this need and provides further related advantages.

"SUMMARY
",0,US20180065917A1.txt
"The present invention generally relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of the functional interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and CD80 (B7-1). Such compounds may either completely disrupt binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and/or CD80 or block or attenuate signal transduction through these receptors. Inhibitors of the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 are useful in the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases.

"The term “prodrug” refers to a precursor of a drug, a compound which upon administration to a patient must undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming an active pharmacological agent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis. Typical examples of prodrugs include compounds that have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety of the active compound. Prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated, dephosphorylated to produce the active compound.

"The inventive compounds according to Formula (I) may be isotopically-labeled by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of according to Formula (I) include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, or iodine. Illustrative of such isotopes are 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 31p, 32P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I, and 125I, respectively. These radiolabeled compounds can be used to measure the biodistribution, tissue concentration and the kinetics of transport and excretion from biological tissues including a subject to which such a labeled compound is administered. Labeled compounds are also used to determine therapeutic effectiveness, the site or mode of action, and the binding affinity of a candidate therapeutic to a pharmacologically important target. Certain radioactive-labeled compounds according to Formula (I), therefore, are useful in drug and/or tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.

"Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from the greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life of compounds containing deuterium. Substitution of hydrogen with deuterium may reduce dose required for therapeutic effect, and hence may be preferred in a discovery or clinical setting. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 1C, 18F, 5O and 13N, provides labeled analogs of the inventive compounds that are useful in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, e.g., for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds according to Formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Preparations and Examples section as set out below using an appropriate isotopic-labeling reagent.

Accordingly, the invention includes compounds that are produced as by-products of enzymatic or non-enzymatic activity on an inventive compound following the administration of such a compound to a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product. Metabolic products, particularly pharmaceutically active metabolites are typically identified by administering a radiolabeled compound of the invention in a detectable dose to a subject, such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or human, for a sufficient period of time during which metabolism occurs, and isolating the metabolic products from urine, blood or other biological samples that are obtained from the subject receiving the radiolabeled compound.

"Description of the Related Art
",0,US10678156B2.txt
"In recent years, color images have become very popular, and a demand for the enhancement of image quality has increased. In an offset ink, a gravure ink, a paint, an ink jet ink, an ink for color filters, a toner, and the like, a technique for improving the dispersibility of inexpensive organic pigments has been demanded in order to obtain high clearness and tinting strength. As one of techniques for improving the dispersibility, it has been proposed to add a dispersant to a pigment. In particular, in order to improve the dispersibility of a pigment in toner particles, various dispersants have been proposed in a toner of each color, such as yellow, magenta, cyan, and black.

"A pigment dispersion for use in an ink jet ink and a pigment dispersion for use in a color filter, for example, which are used for purposes other than a toner, have been generally manufactured by a chemical or physical pigment surface modification technique. Japanese Patent No. 3826615 discloses, as a physical surface modification technique, a method utilizing physical adsorption, specifically, a method for obtaining a pigment dispersible in water in which a phthalocyanine derivative having a hydrophilic group or the like is adsorbed to the pigment particle surface and an aqueous ink using the pigment.

"SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
",0,US10678156B2.txt
"According to a former method, due to the fact that it has been required to add a large amount of a dispersant in order to obtain a certain level of pigment dispersibility and the dispersant is a high molecular weight compound, adverse effects, such as a viscosity increase due to the addition of a large amount of the dispersant, have occurred, so that a good toner has not been able to be created.
",0,US10678156B2.txt
"Moreover, according to the method described in Japanese Patent No. 3826615, a state of being dispersed in water has been able to be created but, when used for an ink jet ink, for example, the storage stability of a practical use level has not been secured in some cases.
",0,US10678156B2.txt

As the actual measured value, the average value of the measured values obtained by performing the measurement 3 times was adopted. The measuring time was set to 120 seconds and the refractive index was set to 1.8 (carbon material) and 1.6 (organic pigment).

"The present invention relates to phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices, and to compounds which may be used in such devices, especially in hole transporting and/or electron blocking layers thereof.
",0,US10868254B2.txt
"In OLEDs, the electroluminescence (EL) characteristic of certain organic materials is used. In EL devices, an application of a voltage creates suitable charge carriers which form, if re-combined, activated conditions, which return into the basic condition by emission of light. For improving the efficiency, the organic light-emitting diodes very often have, amongst the emission layer, also charge transporting layers which are responsible for transport of negative and positive charge carriers into the emission layer. These charge transporting layers are grouped, depending on the charge carrier transported, into hole conductors and electron conductors. A quite similar set of layers is known for photovoltaic devices, such as organic solar cells. Organic semiconducting devices having several layers can be produced by known methods, for example evaporation under vacuum or deposition from solution.
",0,US10868254B2.txt
"In other words, in case of organic light-emitting diodes, light is produced and emitted by the injection of charge carriers, electrons from one side, holes from the other, from the contacts into adjacent organic layers as a result of an externally applied voltage, subsequent formation of excitons (electron-hole pairs) in an active zone, and radiant recombination of these excitons. The most usual OLED structure with the positive electrode (anode) adjacent to the substrate is schematically depicted on FIG. 1, wherein the numbers 1-9 stand for the following layers:

"An important property of organic semiconducting materials is their conductivity. The conductivity of a thin layer sample can be measured by, for example, the so-called two-point method. At this, a voltage is applied to the thin layer and the current flowing through the layer is measured. The measured resistance, respectively conductivity, results by considering the geometry of the contacts and the thickness of the layer of the sample.
",0,US10868254B2.txt
"In an OLED, the operational voltage (or, more exactly, the overall electrical resistance) is given not only by resistances and thicknesses of particular layers, but also by energetic barriers for charge carrier injection from a particular layer to the adjacent one. The power efficiency of the device (conversion of the electrical power in the light flux at the given wavelength or in the given colour range) depends on Joule losses given by the overall resistance and on the efficiency of conversion of charge carriers in photons, which depends on the charge carrier (electron-hole) balance and on the quantum efficiency of radiating recombination of the formed electron-hole pairs (excitons) in the device.
",0,US10868254B2.txt
"There is steady effort to develop materials and OLED designs which allow minimizing Joule losses, ensure the charge carrier balance and maximize the quantum efficiency. In minimizing Joule losses, significant improvement brought the design of special charge injecting layers and the introduction of electrically doped charge transporting layers. Specific charge injecting and blocking layers can also improve the charge carrier balance. Most important improvement in quantum efficiency brought an introduction of phosphorescent emitters, which allow exploiting not only singlet excitons, but also the triplet exciton states, which under normal circumstances statistically prevail in the exciton population.

"However, despite impressive results in OLED performance achieved thank to previous material and design development, the OLED efficiency is still significantly below its theoretical limits and many other OLED-performance parameters like luminosity and lifetime can be also further improved.

"It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved phosphorescent OLEDs having lower operating voltage and/or higher efficiency than devices using hole transporting and electron blocking matrices according to the state of the art.

"Further research helped clarifying relationships with the structure of the compounds tested and confirmed that the improvement is rather general. Table 1 shows the experimental results obtained by the procedure described in detail in the examples below. In the experimental OLEDs tested, the hole transporting layer was doped with a p-dopant, what is symbolized with the p-symbol in the substrate/HTL/EBL column. In the table, to the compounds showing voltage lower voltage than reference, negative values were assigned in the voltage column. Oppositely, a positive value in the voltage column shows unfavourable, higher average voltage observed at the set of devices comprising inventive compound in comparison with the average voltage measured on the set of reference devices prepared under the same conditions. In the efficiency column, the average efficiency of devices comprising an inventive compound higher than the average efficiency of comparative devices is positive, whereas unfavourable lower efficiency in comparison with reference has negative sign. The last column in the table shows the arithmetic difference between the value in the efficiency column and the value in the voltage column. The resulting value was used as a benchmark for assessing the overall performance. Its positive value in at least one from the three rows shows that at least in one application—if the compound was used as an EBL, as an HTL, or in both layers—shows that in this particular case, the percentage voltage improvement has overweighed the percentage efficiency decrease or, oppositely, that the percentage efficiency improvement overweighed the undesired voltage increase, or that there was an improvement in both properties. In fluorescent blue OLED, there was uniformly no particular (in at least one—efficiency or voltage—value) improvement at all for all compounds tested. Consequently, all overall performance values were strongly negative. Surprisingly, in the phosphorescent OLED, the only combination of the structural features of the substituents tested which unequivocally failed (afforded negative overall performance in all applications) was the R23 substituent defined as phenyl bearing at least one strongly electron withdrawing group. The gained knowledge was exploited for providing new hole transporting and electron-blocking matrix materials, particularly useful in OLEDs comprising triplet emitters.

"1,3,5-Tribromobenzene, the boronic acid and Pd(PPh3)4 were dissolved in a mixture of toluene and ethanol. A degassed 2M aqueous Na2CO3 solution was added. The mixture was refluxed for 18 hours. After cooling to room temperature the organic phase was separated from the aqueous one. The aqueous phase was extracted with toluene three times. The combined organic phases were evaporated to dryness and the residue was filtered over a pad of silica gel using dichloromethane (DCM) as eluent. After evaporating the solvents the crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using hexane:DCM mixtures as an eluent. In thin layer chromatography (TLC), the upper main spot was identified as the desired product and the one below as the 3,5-disubstituted bromobenzene side product.

"The dibromo compound was solved in ether and the flask was shielded from light by aluminium foil. The solution was cooled to −80° C. and butyllithium was added within 30 minutes. After butyllithium addition, the solution was kept at −80° C. for 90 minutes. Under vigorous stirring, copper(II) chloride was added in one shot. The solution was allowed to warm to room temperature and to stir overnight. TLC indicated consumption of the starting material and formation of a new product as the only component in the mixture. The mixture was washed three times with 10% aqueous NH4OH, once with brine and once with water. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and filtered through a pad of silica gel by using DCM/hexane 1:1. After evaporation of the solvents, the crude product was washed in boiling methanol for 15 minutes and then filtered and dried.

"Under an inert atmosphere, the secondary amine, the dibromo compound, bis(dibenzylidenaceton)palladium, tri-tert-butylphosphine and potassium-tert-butoxide were combined in a flask and solved in toluene. The mixture was stirred at 80° C. for 80 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. TLC indicated complete consumption of the starting materials. The mixture was filtered through a pad of silica gel, washed with a 1:2 mixture of DCM/hexane and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was stirred in boiling methanol. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was filtered to yield the product. In case TLC indicated still some impurities, column chromatography was used. Finally, all tertiary amines were purified by gradient sublimation under high vacuum (10−6 mbar) condition.

",0,US10868254B2.txt
"Performance testing of the new materials was carried out in bottom emitting phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (OLED). The diodes were processed in vacuum via vapor thermal deposition of organic materials (active layers) and metals (electrodes). Shadow mask techniques were used to structure the devices (active matrix, electrodes). Four OLEDs are prepared on one substrate with an active area of 6.70 mm2 each. 16 identical indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were processed at once in a 4×4 array placed on a table which is pivotable around its vertical axe. Using shutters, each of these 16 substrates can be covered by different set of organic layers. The ITO substrates were cleaned and put into a vapor thermal deposition unit in the 4×4 array. A reference p-doped layer (e.g. H-1 doped with D1; molar ratio (97:3) was deposited on half of these substrates for a final film thickness of 30 nm. On the other half of the plate, the studied inventive material was codeposited with the same p-dopant at the same 97:3 molar ratio and thickness. After a rotation of the plate by 90°, the second (electron blocking) layer is deposited on top of the first layer. Here, half the plate is covered with 10 nm of the reference compound (e.g., TCTA) and the other half with the same inventive material as used in the first layer (see FIG. 1). The reference devices (FIG. 1, field D) were thus always processed together with the devices comprising the inventive materials. This approach allows assessing performance of new material in comparison with the reference independent from possible day-to-day variations of deposition rates, vacuum quality or other tool performance parameters. As each field contains 16 identically prepared OLEDs and the performance parameters were estimated for each of these 16 OLEDs, statistical evaluation of the obtained experimental results unequivocally showed the statistical significance of the observed average values reported in the Table 1.

"Since most chemotherapies are accompanied with serious side effects, finding an alternative cancer therapy is an important topic in cancer medical research. In recent years, Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) has attracted much attention as a novel cancer therapy of a radioisotope.
",0,US10689404B1.txt
"The principle of BNCT is to inject a boron-containing compound containing a boron 10 isotope (10B) into cancer cells, and irradiate low-energy neutron beams, so that 10B atoms in the boron-containing compound generate low-penetration-degree rays (7Li and 4He) after undergoing a nuclear fission reaction to damage the cancer cells. Since the cell penetration ability of the low-penetration-degree rays is about equal to the diameter of one cell, surrounding normal cell tissues will not be affected while the cancer cells are damaged.
",0,US10689404B1.txt
"The key to the success of BNCT is to have an uptake of boron-containing compound in addition to thermal neutron beams. After a boron-containing drug is intravenously injected into a human body, the content of boron entering tumor cells must be higher than the content of boron of normal tissue cells. At present, the requirement of clinical trials is that the content of boron of tumor cells must be 2.5 times or above than that of normal tissue cells. Boronophenylalanine (BPA), a common boron-containing compound, has been clinically used for many years. However, BPA only possess one boronic acid group, which limit its ability to deliver sufficient amount of boron to the target tumorous tissues in clinical application.

"In eukaryote from yeast to human, a decomposition process for recycling or metabolizing unnecessary cellular component such as protein and organelle called autophagy exists universally. Autophagy has been considered to be a mechanism for surviving a starved state by decomposing oneself non-selectively for securing the nutrition in a nutrition-starved state, however, later study revealed that it involves maintenance of homeostasis, programmed cell death in ontogenic process, suppression of diseases such as Huntington's disease, suppression of canceration of cells through removing denatured protein, preventing accumulation of excess mount of protein produced in the cells, removing deteriorated organelle or pathogenic microorganisms.
",0,US20200172489A1.txt
"It is known that autophagy has a plurality of processes with different mechanisms such as macro autophagy, micro autophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Early research using an electron microscope revealed that, in macro autophagy, a separation membrane composed of bilayer membrane gradually extends to encapsulate degradation substrates such as unnecessary substances to form autophagosomes, and then the content of the autophagosome is decomposed by digestive enzyme in autolysosomes formed by fusing the autophagosome and lysosomes. Any processes are common in that the decomposition substrate is migrated into lysosome, where it is subjected to decompose.
",0,US20200172489A1.txt
"In recent years, molecular mechanism of the autophagy has been elucidated and genes associated with autophagy have been identified. As a method for detecting autophagy, a method in which cells are lysed and the expression level of factors associated with autophagy from mRNA obtained is determined by a Western Blot method or immunostaining method is known (for example, see Patent Literature 1). However, this method cannot be applied to a cell live imaging since cells are lysed in this method.

"As methods for detecting autophagy in living cells, introducing a plasmid vector coding LC3-GFP in which GFP is incorporated into LC3, a kind of gene product involving the formation of the autophagosomes (Atg protein) into cells and monitoring the expression of LC3 by a luminescence of GFP (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 1). Since the fluorescent intensity of GFP decreases under acidic condition, it is superior for detecting the early stage of autophagy. However, this method cannot be applied to any kind of cells since it requires expression of LC3-GFP in the cells.
",0,US20200172489A1.txt
"A typical intracellular imaging method includes a method in which an intensity of fluorescence from a pH responsive fluorescent protein called Keima expressed in the cells (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 2) is monitored. The excitation spectrum of Keima varies in accordance with pH. A short wavelength (440 nm) peak is predominant in a neutral environment, whereas a long wavelength (550 nm) peak is predominant in an acidic environment. In a ratio (550 nm/440 nm) image obtained from two images measured using these two different excitation wavelengths, Keima in the neutral environment shows lower ratio value, whereas Keima in the acidic environment shows higher ratio value. Using this phenomenon, each step of autophagy (formation of autophagosome, fusion with lysosomes etc.) may be detected by reading out the pH change of the decomposition substrate associated with autophagy from the fluorescence image. However, this method is not applicable to all kinds of cells because the expression of Keima in the cells is required.

"On the other hand, a method using monodansyl cadaverin (MDC) is known as an example of a method for detecting autophagy using low molecular fluorescent dye (for example, see Non-Patent Literature 3). However, the excitation wavelength of MDC is in an ultraviolet region, which may cause problems of cytotoxicity and breaching. Recently, CYTO-ID (Trademark) has been developed by Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. as a novel dye by which the problems of MDC have been solved (see Non-Patent Literature 4).

"In the fluorescent compound represented by General Formulae shown above, naphthalimide and perylene imide which emit a fluorescence in a hydrophobic field as a fluorescent chromophore group. Therefore, as the fluorescent intensity increases by incorporation into autophagosomes or autolysosomes, autophagy may read out by the fluorescent emission. Also, regulation of hydrophobicity and impartion of pH responsivity of fluorescent intensity using photo induced electron transfer (PET) or fluorescent wavelength may be easily performed by selecting functional groups R1 to R5 appropriately. In addition, combining a plurality of the fluorescent compounds having different sensitivities to internal conditions of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in each step of autophagy (such as pH) enables the observation of each step of autophagy. Particularly, in addition to the sensitivities to internal conditions of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, using a combination of one or more selected from a group consisting of fluorescent compounds represented by General Formula (Ia) shown below and a salt thereof and one or more selected from a group consisting of fluorescent compounds represented by General Formula (IIb) and a salt thereof; or one or more selected from a group consisting of fluorescent compounds represented by General Formula (Ib) shown below and a salt thereof and one or more selected from a group consisting of fluorescent compounds represented by General Formula (IIa) and a salt thereof having different emission wavelength enables detecting each step of autophagy stepwise.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0,US20180072718A1.txt
"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) originally cloned from hematopoietic progenitor cells is a member of MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) family, which includes MAP4K1/HPK1, MAP4K2/GCK, MAP4K3/GLK, MAP4K4/HGK, MAP4K5/KHS, and MAP4K6/MINK (Hu, M. C., et al., Genes Dev, 1996. 10(18): p. 2251-64). HPK1 is of particular interest because it is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and mast cells (Hu, M. C., et al., Genes Dev, 1996. 10(18): p. 2251-64; Kiefer, F., et al., EMBO J, 1996. 15(24): p. 7013-25). HPK1 kinase activity has been shown to be induced upon activation of T cell receptors (TCR) (Liou, J., et al., Immunity, 2000. 12(4): p. 399-408), B cell receptors (BCR) (Liou, J., et al., Immunity, 2000. 12(4): p. 399-408), transforming growth factor receptor (TGF-βR) (Wang, W., et al., J Biol Chem, 1997. 272(36): p. 22771-5; Zhou, G., et al., J Biol Chem, 1999. 274(19): p. 13133-8), or GS-coupled PGE2 receptors (EP2 and EP4) (Ikegami, R., et al., J Immunol, 2001. 166(7): p. 4689-96). As such, HPK1 regulates diverse functions of various immune cells.
",0,US20180072718A1.txt
"HPK1 is important in regulating the functions of various immune cells and it has been implicated in autoimmune diseases and anti-tumor immunity (Shui, J. W., et al., Nat Immunol, 2007. 8(1): p. 84-91; Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48). HPK1 knockout mice were more susceptible to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Shui, J. W., et al., Nat Immunol, 2007. 8(1): p. 84-91). In human, HPK1 was downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of psoriatic arthritis patients or T cells of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (Batliwalla, F. M., et al., Mol Med, 2005. 11(1-12): p. 21-9). Those observations suggested that attenuation of HPK1 activity may contribute to autoimmunity in patients. Furthermore, HPK1 may also control anti-tumor immunity via T cell-dependent mechanisms. In the PGE2-producing Lewis lung carcinoma tumor model, the tumors developed more slowly in HPK1 knockout mice as compared to wild-type mice (see US 2007/0087988). In addition, it was shown that adoptive transfer of HPK1 deficient T cells was more effective in controlling tumor growth and metastasis than wild-type T cells (Alzabin, S., et al., Cancer Immunol Immunother, 2010. 59(3): p. 419-29). Similarly, BMDCs from HPK1 knockout mice were more efficient to mount a T cell response to eradicate Lewis lung carcinoma as compared to wild-type BMDCs (Alzabin, S., et al., J Immunol, 2009. 182(10): p. 6187-94). These data, in conjunction with the restricted expression of HPK1 in hematopoietic cells and lack of effect on the normal development of immune cells, suggest that HPK1 may be an excellent drug target for enhancing antitumor immunity. Accordingly, there is a need for new compounds that modulate HPK1 activity.

"HPK1 Kinase
",0,US20180072718A1.txt
"Extensive studies have established that HPK1 is a negative regulator of T cell and B cell activation (Hu, M. C., et al., Genes Dev, 1996. 10(18): p. 2251-64; Kiefer, F., et al., EMBO J, 1996. 15(24): p. 7013-25). HPK1-deficient mouse T cells showed dramatically increased activation of TCR proximal signaling, enhanced IL-2 production, and hyper-proliferation in vitro upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Shui, J. W., et al., Nat Immunol, 2007. 8(1): p. 84-91). Similar to T cells, HPK1 knockout B cells produced much higher levels of IgM and IgG isoforms after KLH immunization and displayed hyper-proliferation potentially as a result of enhanced BCR signaling. Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48. Mechanistically, during TCR or BCR signaling, HPK1 is activated by LCK/ZAP70 (T cells) or SYK/LYN (B cells) mediated-Tyr379 phosphorylation and its subsequent binding to adaptor protein SLP-76 (T cells) or BLNK (B cells) (Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48). Activated HPK1 phosphorylates SLP-76 on Ser376 or BLNK on Thr152, leading to the recruitment of signaling molecule 14-3-3 and ultimate ubiquitination-mediated degradation of SLP-76 or BLNK (Liou, J., et al., Immunity, 2000. 12(4): p. 399-408; Di Bartolo, V., et al., J Exp Med, 2007. 204(3): p. 681-91). As SLP-76 and BLNK are essential for TCR/BCR-mediated signaling activation (e.g. ERK, phospholipase Cγ1, calcium flux, and NFAT activation), HPK1-mediated downregulation of these adaptor proteins provide a negative feedback mechanism to attenuate signaling intensity during T cell or B cell activation (Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48).
",0,US20180072718A1.txt
"The bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BDMCs) from HPK1 knockout mice showed higher expression of co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. CD80/CD86) and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12, TNF-α etc), and demonstrated superior ability to stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo as compared to wild-type DCs (Alzabin, S., et al., J Immunol, 2009. 182(10): p. 6187-94). These data suggest that HPK1 is also an important negative regulator of dendritic cell activation (Alzabin, S., et al., J Immunol, 2009. 182(10): p. 6187-94). However, the signaling mechanisms underlying HPK-1 mediated negative regulation of DC activation remains to be elucidated.
",0,US20180072718A1.txt
"In contrast, HPK1 appears to be a positive regulator of suppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Treg) (Sawasdikosol, S. et al., The journal of immunology, 2012. 188(supplement 1): p. 163). HPK1 deficient mouse Foxp3+ Tregs were defective in suppressing TCR-induced effector T cell proliferation, and paradoxically gained the ability to produce IL-2 following TCR engagement (Sawasdikosol, S. et al., The Journal of Immunology, 2012. 188(supplement 1): p. 163). These data suggest that HPK1 is an important regulator of Treg functions and peripheral self-tolerance.
",0,US20180072718A1.txt
"HPK1 was also involved in PGE2-mediated inhibition of CD4+ T cell activation (Ikegami, R., et al., J Immunol, 2001. 166(7): p. 4689-96). Studies published in US 2007/0087988 indicated that HPK1 kinase activity was increased by exposure to physiological concentrations of PGE2 in CD4+ T cells and this effect was mediated by PEG2-induced PKA activation. The proliferation of HPK1 deficient T cells was resistant to the suppressive effects of PGE2 (see US 2007/0087988). Therefore, PGE2-mediated activation of HPK1 may represent a novel regulatory pathway of modulating immune response.

"Specifically, a labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to identify and/or evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a HPK1 protein by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the HPK1, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to a HPK1 protein (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the HPK1 protein directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.

"The present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device comprising the same.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"BACKGROUND ART
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"In general, the term “organic light-emitting phenomenon” refers to a phenomenon in which electrical energy is converted to light energy by means of an organic material.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"An organic light-emitting device using the organic light-emitting phenomenon has a structure usually including an anode, a cathode, and an organic material layer interposed therebetween. In this regard, the organic material layer may have, for the most part, a multilayer structure consisting of different materials, for example, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer. In the organic light-emitting device having such a structure, application of a voltage between the two electrodes injects a hole from the anode and an electron from the cathode to the organic layer. In the luminescent zone, the hole and the electron recombine to produce an exciton. When the exciton returns to the ground state from the excited state, the molecule of the organic layer emits light. Such an organic light-emitting device is known to have characteristics such as self-luminescence, high luminance, high efficiency, low driving voltage, a wide viewing angle, high contrast, and high-speed response.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"The materials used as organic layers in organic light-emitting devices may be divided into luminescent materials and charge-carrying materials, for example, a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an electron injection material, and an electron transport material. As for the luminescent materials, there are two main families according to molecular weight: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. The light-emitting mechanism forms the basis for classification of the luminescent materials as fluorescent or phosphorescent materials, which use excitons in singlet and triplet states, respectively. Further, luminescent materials may be divided according to color into blue, green, and red light-emitting materials. Further, yellow and reddish yellow light-emitting materials have been developed in order to achieve more natural colors.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"Meanwhile, when a single material is employed as the luminescent material, intermolecular actions cause the wavelength of maximum luminescence to shift toward a longer wavelength, resulting in reduced color purity and light emission efficiency due to the light attenuation. In this regard, a host-dopant system may be used as a luminescent material so as to increase the color purity and the light emission efficiency through energy transfer.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"This is based on the principle whereby, when a dopant is smaller in energy band gap than a host accounting for the light-emitting layer, the addition of a small amount of the dopant to the host generates excitons from the light-emitting layer so that the excitons are transported to the dopant, emitting light at high efficiency. Here, light of desired wavelengths can be obtained depending on the kind of dopant because the wavelength of the host moves to the wavelength range of the dopant.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"In order for organic light-emitting devices to sufficiently exhibit the aforementioned outstanding properties, materials accounting for organic layers in the devices, for example, hole injection materials, hole transport materials, light-emitting materials, electron transport materials, electron injection materials, etc., should be based on stable and effective materials in advance.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"Application of an electric current to such an organic light-emitting device induces the injection of holes and electrons from the anode and the cathode, respectively. After being transported respectively by a hole transport layer and an electron transport layer, the injected holes and electrons recombine in a light-emitting layer to produce excitons. The excitons return to the ground state, emitting light. According to the light-emitting mechanism, the light is classified as fluorescence emission with singlet transition to singlet and phosphorescence emission with triplet transition singlet. The fluorescence and the phosphorescence may be used as luminescent light sources of organic light-emitting devices.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"In fluorescent organic light-emitting devices, only the formation of singlet excitons results in the emission of useful radiation, and thus there is a theoretical limit of 25% in the internal quantum efficiency of fluorescent organic light-emitting devices. On the other hand, phosphorescent light, which uses triplet excitons, has been extensively studied because its emission efficiency is far superior to that of fluorescent light.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"So far, the most widely known phosphorescent host material is CBP, and organic light-emitting devices employing a hole barrier layer of BCP, BAlq, etc. are also known.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"However, although devices employing phosphorescent materials are higher in terms of efficiency than those employing fluorescent materials, conventional phosphorescent host materials, such as BAlq or CBP, have room for improvement because they require high driving voltages and are unsatisfactory in terms of lifespan.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"With regard to related arts pertaining to such phosphorescent materials for use in light-emitting devices, reference may be made to Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2011-0013220 A (Feb. 9, 2011), which discloses an organic compound having a 6-membered aromatic or heteroaromatic ring frame grafted with an aromatic heterocyclic ring, and Japanese Patent Publication No. 2010-166070 A (Jul. 29, 2010), which discloses an organic compound having a substituted or unsubstituted pyrimidine or quinazoline frame grafted with an aryl or heteroaryl ring.
",0,US20180072753A1.txt
"Despite enormous efforts to prepare luminescent materials for use in organic light-emitting devices or electron transport materials, there is still a continued need to develop organic light-emitting devices that exhibit higher light emission efficiency and which can be driven at low voltages.

Preferable is an organic substrate or transparent plastic substrate that exhibits excellent transparency, surface smoothness, ease of handling, and waterproofness. As the anode electrode material, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), tin oxide (SnO2), or zinc oxide (ZnO), which are transparent and superior in terms of conductivity, may be used.

"A hole injection layer material is applied to the top of the anode electrode 20 by thermal deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating to form a hole injection layer 30. Subsequently, using thermal deposition in a vacuum or spin coating, a hole transport layer material is applied to the hole injection layer 30 to form a hole transport layer 40.

"So long as it is typically used in the art, any hole injection layer material may be used in the present invention, without particular limitations. Examples include 2-TNATA [4,4',4″-tris(2-naphthylphenyl-phenylamino)-triphenylamine], NPD[N,N'-di(l-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine)], TPD[N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine], DNTPD[N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis-[4-(phenyl-m-tolyl-amino)-phenyl]-biphenyl-4,4'-dia mine], and the like, but are not limited thereto.

"Further, any material that is typically known in the art may be used for the hole transport layer without particular limitations. Examples include N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-[1,1-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine (TPD) and N,N'-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (a-NPD), but are not limited thereto.

"Then, an organic light-emitting layer 50 is deposited on the hole transport layer 40, optionally followed by the formation of a hole barrier layer (not shown) on the organic light-emitting layer 50 by deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating. When holes traverse the organic light-emitting layer and are introduced into the cathode, the efficiency and lifespan of the device are deteriorated. Formed of a material with a low HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level, the hole barrier layer serves to prevent the introduction of holes into the cathode. Any material that has a higher ionization potential than the light-emitting compound and which is also able to carry electrons may be used for the hole barrier layer without limitations. Representative among hole barrier materials are BAlq, BCP, and TPBI.

"Using a vacuum deposition method or a spin-coating method, an electron transport layer 60 may be deposited on the hole barrier layer and may then be overlaid with an electron injection layer 70. A cathode metal is deposited on the electron injection layer 70 by thermal deposition in a vacuum to form a cathode 80, thus obtaining an organic EL device. Here, the cathode may be made of lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), aluminum-lithium (Al-Li), calcium (Ca), magnesium-indium (Mg-In), or magnesium-silver (Mg-Ag).
