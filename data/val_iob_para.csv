"BACKGROUND
",0.0,218,US10633340B1
Stimulating signals are typically carried by acetylcholine within a nervous system synapse.,0.0,309,US10633340B1
" Such signals may be discontinued by a specific type of cholinesterase enzymes, acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down acetylcholine.",0.0,443,US10633340B1
" If cholinesterase inhibiting chemicals are present, they may then prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine thereby disrupting normal nervous system activity.",0.0,599,US10633340B1
" For example, certain chemical classes of pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, may result in toxic cholinesterase inhibition.",0.0,740,US10633340B1
" Accordingly, if an individual is regularly exposed to such inhibitors, there remains a need to prophylactically or therapeutically treat such toxicity.",0.0,892,US10633340B1
" Among other things, individuals or animals who may have been exposed to a carbamate type cholinesterase inhibitor may currently be treated with atropine, and those exposed to organophosphates may beneficially be treated with a pralidoxime antidote.

"DETAILED DESCRIPTION
",0.0,3865,US10633340B1
"As noted above, current methods to synthesize HLo-7 DMS, HI-6 DMS and obidoxime DMS require use of chemical linkers such as bis(2-chloromethyl) ether (BCME) (2) or bis(2-methylsulfonoxymethyl) ether (BMME) (3), which are identified as extremely carcinogenic, with an exposure limit of 0.0003 ppm.",0.0,4161,US10633340B1

" Reference to X− is therefore reference to the anionic form, either Cl—, Br—, I— or −OSO2CH3.",0.0,4635,US10633340B1
" Accordingly, in compound 6, when R1 is hydrogen, R2 is —CH═NOH, and R3 and R4 are both —CH═NOH, and X− is −OSO2CH3, the compound is HLo-7.",0.0,4774,US10633340B1

" As for the luminescent materials, there are two main families according to molecular weight: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers.",0.0,1830,US20180072753A1
" The light-emitting mechanism forms the basis for classification of the luminescent materials as fluorescent or phosphorescent materials, which use excitons in singlet and triplet states, respectively.",0.0,2031,US20180072753A1
" Further, luminescent materials may be divided according to color into blue, green, and red light-emitting materials.",0.0,2148,US20180072753A1

"“Antibody” means whole antibodies and any antigen binding fragment (i.e., “antigen-binding portion”) or single chain variants thereof.",0.0,9743,US20180110873A1
 A whole antibody is a protein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds.,0.0,9875,US20180110873A1
" Each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (VH) and a heavy chain constant region comprising three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3.",0.0,10015,US20180110873A1
" Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (VL or Vk) and a light chain constant region comprising one single domain, CL.",0.0,10151,US20180110873A1
" The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with more conserved framework regions (FRs).",0.0,10342,US20180110873A1
" Each VH and VL comprises three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino- to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4.",0.0,10499,US20180110873A1
 The variable regions contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen.,0.0,10577,US20180110873A1
" The constant regions may mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system.",0.0,10800,US20180110873A1
" An antibody is said to “specifically bind” to an antigen X if the antibody binds to antigen X with a KD of 5×10−8 M or less, more preferably 1×10−8 M or less, more preferably 6×10−9 M or less, more preferably 3×10−9 M or less, even more preferably 2×10−9 M or less.",0.0,11066,US20180110873A1
" The antibody can be chimeric, humanized, or, preferably, human.",0.0,11130,US20180110873A1

" It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody, such as (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fab' fragment, which is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, for example, Abbas et al., Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 6th Ed., Saunders Elsevier 2007); (iv) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (v) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (vi) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; (vii) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR); and (viii) a nanobody, a heavy chain variable region containing a single variable domain and two constant domains.",0.0,12746,US20180110873A1
" Preferred antigen binding fragments are Fab, F(ab')2, Fab', Fv, and Fd fragments.",0.0,12828,US20180110873A1
" Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are encoded by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv, or scFv); see, e.g., Bird et al.",0.0,13177,US20180110873A1

" Under the influence of an applied voltage, a VA device mainly produces a bending deformation of liquid crystal molecules, ECB produces a splay deformation of liquid crystal molecules, and the twisted display produces a twist deformation of liquid crystal molecules; the response times thereof are also inversely proportional to bending, splay, and twist elastic constants, respectively, because in general cases for most liquid crystals, the bending elastic constant of liquid crystal is greater than the splay elastic constant and the splay elastic constant is greater than the twist elastic constant, which is also the reason why the VA device has a faster response time.

"BACKGROUND
",0.0,509,US20200115323A1
Human skin acts as a barrier to physical and chemical stimuli from the external environment.,0.0,601,US20200115323A1
" However, in the skin of patients with inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, it can be seen that skin barrier function and/or water retention function in a stratum corneum is significantly reduced compared to normal skin, and the cause of such dysfunction has been found to be due to a reduction of ceramide in the skin (Non-Patent Document
",0.0,958,US20200115323A1
"Ceramide, one of sphingolipids, has a structure in which fatty acids are linked to sphingosine, and accounts for 40-50% of intercorneocyte lipids that make up the skin stratum corneum.",0.0,1142,US20200115323A1
 The skin stratum corneum acts as a protective barrier that protects against penetration of harmful substances or microorganisms from the external environment into the skin tissue.,0.0,1322,US20200115323A1
" At this time, ceramide forms a layered structure of the skin stratum corneum, and thus has been known to play a central role in maintaining moisture and barrier, which are basic functions of the skin.",0.0,1523,US20200115323A1
" In maintaining the basic functions of the skin normally, the significance of ceramide has also been proved for a necessity by experimental results that only when the ceramide biosynthesis is inhibited or when the ceramide content is decreased, the barrier function of the skin is not restored, the moisture evaporation of the skin is increased, and various skin diseases are worsened (Non-Patent Document 2).",0.0,1932,US20200115323A1
" In addition, when the aging of the skin is progressed or the ceramide content is reduced by external stimulation, it has been known that the skin may be restored to be normal by supplementing ceramides.
",0.0,2136,US20200115323A1
"For the purpose of supplementing such ceramides, searches have been made for natural animals and plants, and microbial systems, and it has been known that the ceramides may be extracted from various animals, plants, and microorganisms (yeasts) containing ceramides.",0.0,2401,US20200115323A1
" However, the ceramides are present in extremely small amounts in these animals plants, and microorganisms, and the cost of their extract production is too expensive, and solubility in various solvents, cosmetics, and raw materials used in cleaning products is very low.",0.0,2671,US20200115323A1
" Thus, the synthesis of ceramides with the same structure as natural ceramides or pseudoceramides with similar structures to natural ceramides has been studied by many scientists.",0.0,2850,US20200115323A1
" Examples thereof include Japanese Patent Documents 1 and 2 of Huawang Co., Ltd. of Japan, and Patent Document 3 of Unilever Co., Ltd. of Germany and Patent Documents 4 and 5 of AMOREPACIFIC, and Patent Document 6 of Aekyung Industrial Co., Ltd. in Korea.

"In eukaryote from yeast to human, a decomposition process for recycling or metabolizing unnecessary cellular component such as protein and organelle called autophagy exists universally.",0.0,325,US20200172489A1
" Autophagy has been considered to be a mechanism for surviving a starved state by decomposing oneself non-selectively for securing the nutrition in a nutrition-starved state, however, later study revealed that it involves maintenance of homeostasis, programmed cell death in ontogenic process, suppression of diseases such as Huntington's disease, suppression of canceration of cells through removing denatured protein, preventing accumulation of excess mount of protein produced in the cells, removing deteriorated organelle or pathogenic microorganisms.
",0.0,881,US20200172489A1
"It is known that autophagy has a plurality of processes with different mechanisms such as macro autophagy, micro autophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy.",0.0,1038,US20200172489A1
" Early research using an electron microscope revealed that, in macro autophagy, a separation membrane composed of bilayer membrane gradually extends to encapsulate degradation substrates such as unnecessary substances to form autophagosomes, and then the content of the autophagosome is decomposed by digestive enzyme in autolysosomes formed by fusing the autophagosome and lysosomes.",0.0,1422,US20200172489A1
" Any processes are common in that the decomposition substrate is migrated into lysosome, where it is subjected to decompose.
",0.0,1547,US20200172489A1
"In recent years, molecular mechanism of the autophagy has been elucidated and genes associated with autophagy have been identified.",0.0,1678,US20200172489A1
" As a method for detecting autophagy, a method in which cells are lysed and the expression level of factors associated with autophagy from mRNA obtained is determined by a Western Blot method or immunostaining method is known (for example, see Patent Literature 1).",0.0,1943,US20200172489A1
" However, this method cannot be applied to a cell live imaging since cells are lysed in this method.

" Using this phenomenon, each step of autophagy (formation of autophagosome, fusion with lysosomes etc.)",0.0,3415,US20200172489A1
 may be detected by reading out the pH change of the decomposition substrate associated with autophagy from the fluorescence image.,0.0,3546,US20200172489A1
