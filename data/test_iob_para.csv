"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0.0,752,EP3284738A1
"Glutamate which is the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals plays an important role in maintaining the normal function of nervous system and also plays an important role in many pathophysiological processes such as pain, neurodegenerative lesions and epilepsy.",0.0,1059,EP3284738A1
" At the same time, the massive release and accumulation of glutamate in the nervous system is the pathology basis of a variety of nerve cell damage and neurodegenerative disease, i.e., the neurotoxic effect of glutamate, eventually leading to neuronal death.",0.0,1317,EP3284738A1
" The excitotoxicity lead by glutamate activating its receptor and the oxidative toxicity lead by inhibiting of glutamate / cystine transporters on the cell membrane are the origins of many nervous system diseases such as cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, thus making glutamate receptors become one of the therapeutic targets of these diseases.
",0.0,1677,EP3284738A1
Glutamate receptors (GluR) are mainly divided into ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs).,0.0,1814,EP3284738A1
" The ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist has achieved some therapeutic effect in the animal model by directly blocking the postsynaptic effect of glutamate, but it also blocks normal excitatory transmission and produces serious side effects, such as psychiatric symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, etc., thus limiting the clinical application of such compounds; and metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibit the release of glutamate through the presynaptic mechanism, thus reducing the toxic and side effect of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, and are expected to become a new target for the treatment of certain neurological diseases.

mGluRs is one of the members of the C family of the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) superfamily.,0.0,2557,EP3284738A1
" According to its protein sequence homology, receptor-coupled second messenger system signal transduction mechanism and specificity for different agonists, it can be divided into three categories.",0.0,2753,EP3284738A1
" The first category mGluRI (mGluR1, mGluR5) mainly is distributed in the postsynaptic region, the mGluR1 receptors are also distributed in the glial cells, and the mGluR5 receptors are distributed in the marginal cortex and basal ganglia, which are closely related to the morphology of dendritic spines and play an important role in synaptic transmission and plasticity.",0.0,3123,EP3284738A1
" The second category mGluR II (mGluR2, mGluR3) mainly locates in the presynaptic region, wherein mGluR2 receptors locate in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, thalamus synaptic axons, mGluR3 receptors are also widely distributed in the brain, including glia.",0.0,3379,EP3284738A1
" The third category mGluRIII (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, mGluR8) is also distributed in the presynaptic region, mGluR 4/7/8 locates in the basal ganglia movement loop, and mGluR6 receptors are in the retinal neurons.",0.0,3592,EP3284738A1
" There is about 70% homology in the same mGluR group, and only about 45% homology between the different groups.",0.0,3703,EP3284738A1
" mGluR5 mainly locates in the neuronal postsynaptic excitatory terminal and glia, couples with GÎ±/q protein, activates phospholipase C, and enhances intracellular Ca2+ release.",0.0,3879,EP3284738A1
" Studies have shown that mGluR5 is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), mainly in the areas associated with the nervous system and mental illness such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia, etc..",0.0,4103,EP3284738A1
" Thus, mGluR5 is one of the important targets for the treatment of central nervous system and psychiatric-related diseases.
",0.0,4227,EP3284738A1
"Regarding to the design of medicine to the target, early studies mainly focused on the design of small molecule competitive antagonists for endogenous ligands, but because of the high conservation degree of the mGlu receptor binding sites, it is difficult to obtain a compound having good selectivity to receptor subtypes.",0.0,4549,EP3284738A1
" In addition, many endogenous ligands are often glutamic acid derivatives, lacking suitable pharmacokinetic properties and CNS permeability makes these compounds difficult to use in clinical research.",0.0,4749,EP3284738A1
" In recent years, allosteric modulators of mGlu receptors have attracted widespread attention.",0.0,4843,EP3284738A1
" Compounds bind to non-endogenous ligand sites, do not directly activate or antagonize receptor function, but indirectly increase or decrease glutamate-induced activity, known as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs).",0.0,5102,EP3284738A1
" mGlu receptor allosteric modulators act on the allosteric sites of the GPCR transmembrane region, thus providing greater possibilities for overcoming defects in the selectivity and poor permeability of the mGlu receptor endogenous site competitive antagonists.
",0.0,5364,EP3284738A1
"In recent years, mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator has caused great concern of the majority of scientific research workers and major pharmaceutical companies as a potential treatment drug for fragile X chromosome syndrome, such as Parkinson's disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia (PD-LID), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), autism, pain, anxiety, depression, drug addiction and the like.",0.0,5759,EP3284738A1
" Since 2000, there have been more than 190 mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator patent applications, of which 66 patent applications are filed from 2009 to June 2013; so far at least 9 small molecules have entered the clinical trials, of which 4 compounds are currently undergoing II or III clinical trials such as Mavoglurant, Diproglurant, RG7090 and Fenobam.",0.0,6120,EP3284738A1
" Therefore, mGluR5 negative allosteric regulatory site is regarded as ideal drug target, while designing novel mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator for the treatment of the central nervous system and psychiatric system-related diseases on this basis has very important significance and good application prospects.

"EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), also known as HER1 or ErbB1, is a receptor for cell proliferation and signal transduction of the epithelial growth factor (EGF).",0.0,753,EP3323817A1
" EGFR belongs to a member of the ErbB receptor family which includes EGFR (ErbB-1), HER2/c-neu (ErbB-2), HER3 (ErbB-3) and HER4 (ErbB-4).",0.0,890,EP3323817A1
" EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 170KDa, which belongs to a tyrosine kinase receptor.
",0.0,1008,EP3323817A1
EGFR is located on the surface of cell membranes and is activated by binding to ligands including EGF and TGFÎ±.,0.0,1119,EP3323817A1
" Upon being activated, EGFR undergoes a transition from a monomer to a dimer.",0.0,1196,EP3323817A1
 The dimer includes not only the binding of two identical receptor molecules (homodimerization) but also the binding of different members of the human EGF-associated receptor (HER) tyrosine kinase family (heterodimerization).,0.0,1421,EP3323817A1
" EGFR can activate its intracellular kinase pathways after dimerization, resulting in the phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain and the stimulation to many intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival.
",0.0,1686,EP3323817A1
There exist high or abnormal expressions of EGFR in many solid tumors.,0.0,1756,EP3323817A1
" EGFR is associated with tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, metastasis and the inhibition of apoptosis.",0.0,1880,EP3323817A1
" Possible mechanisms include the followings: enhanced downstream signal transduction caused by the high expressions of EGFR; the sustained activation of EGFR caused by the increased expressions of mutant EGFR receptors or ligands; the enhanced effect of autocrine loops; the destruction of receptor downregulation mechanisms; and the activation of aberrant signaling pathways, etc.",0.0,2261,EP3323817A1
 Overexpressions of EGFR play an important role in the progression of malignant tumors.,0.0,2348,EP3323817A1
" For example, overexpressions of EGFR have been found in gliocyte, kidney cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and other tissues.

" Researches have shown that the structure of Î±-ketoglutaric acid is similar to that of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, and 2-HG competes with Î±-KG, thereby reducing the activity of Î±-KG-dependent enzymes, and resulting in a high methylation of chromatin.",0.0,1307,EP3330263A1

"DETAILED DESCRIPTION
",0.0,5606,US10654800B1
"From a molecular design point of view, the binding potency of vildagliptin and other first generation inhibitors depends on satisfying the distinctive features of the S1 and S2 pockets of DPP-4.",0.0,5800,US10654800B1
" The S1 pocket is a small hydrophobic cleft surrounded by very hydrophobic environment composed of Tyr-547, Trp-659, Tyr-662, Tyr-666, Val-711 and other residues.",0.0,5962,US10654800B1
 The OH of Ser-630 also intrudes into this pocket and is a member of the catalytic triad of residues that attack the scissile electrophilic carbonyl of the substrate peptides (FIG.,0.0,6142,US10654800B1
 2).,0.0,6146,US10654800B1
 The S2 pocket has two main features: two glutamic acids in the bridge area between the S1 and S2 and a large hydrophobic pocket that is lined by Phe-357 and Arg-358.,0.0,6312,US10654800B1
" Glu-205/Glu-206 were found to bind with a basic nitrogen, which is present in all designed DPP-4 inhibitors to date.",0.0,6429,US10654800B1
 The S2 hydrophobic extension can accommodate bulky hydrophobic groups such as adamantane in vildagliptin and sitagliptin since bulkiness secures good selectivity.,0.0,6592,US10654800B1
" The P2 groups are well represented by a wide variety sub-structures including aliphatics, biaryls, heterocyclics, etc.",0.0,6711,US10654800B1
 The presence of a bulky group at this position insures binding selectivity towards DPP-4 over other dipeptidyl peptidases (e.g.,0.0,6839,US10654800B1
" DPP2, DPP8 and DPP9).
",0.0,6862,US10654800B1
The approach taken herein to discover new DPP-4 inhibitors depended on conserving the adamantylamine group attached to glycine as a P2 group and changing the pyrrolylnitrile to variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic groups with small substituents.,0.0,7109,US10654800B1
" In general, the substituents included hydrophobic, hydrophilic, electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups.",0.0,7224,US10654800B1
" In addition, some alicyclic groups were used to complete the SAR coverage of P1 position.",0.0,7314,US10654800B1
" Different ortho, meta and para substituents with different electronic properties were also assessed.",0.0,7415,US10654800B1
" However, the size these substituents was limited in order to lessen the potential negative impact of large groups on the binding with DPP-4.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0.0,199,US10815179B1
"Dicarbinols are useful in a variety of chemical applications such as plasticizers, diluents, wetting agents and paint additives and as intermediates in chemical processes.",0.0,370,US10815179B1
" Diluents, wetting agents and paint additives often are volatile and evaporate into the atmosphere during use.",0.0,480,US10815179B1
" For example, coalescing aids that are added to water-based paints, act as temporary plasticizers in latex emulsions.",0.0,597,US10815179B1
" The coalescing aids lower the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the latex polymer and as the paint dries, the polymers that have been softened by the coalescing aid are allowed to flow together and form a film after the water has left the system.",0.0,847,US10815179B1
 Coalescing aids that are volatile evaporate out of the film.,0.0,908,US10815179B1
" This allows the polymer to return to the original Tg thereby giving harder films for better block and print resistant coatings.
",0.0,1037,US10815179B1
"Due to environmental concerns, the use of volatile materials such as paint additives, plasticizers, diluents, wetting agents and coalescing aids are increasing undesirable.",0.0,1209,US10815179B1
" There is a need for materials that can be used as paint additives, plasticizers, diluents, wetting agents and coalescing aids that exhibit low volatility.",0.0,1364,US10815179B1

Compounds including a polymerizable group (polymerizable compounds) have been used for producing various optical materials.,0.0,428,US20180002276A1
" For example, a polymer having a uniform orientation can be prepared by polymerizing a polymerizable composition including a polymerizable compound which has been arranged in a pattern while being in a liquid crystal state.",0.0,651,US20180002276A1
" Such a polymer can be used for producing polarizing plates, phase-retardation plates, and the like, which are necessary in the production of displays.",0.0,802,US20180002276A1
" The polymerizable composition typically includes two or more polymerizable compounds in order to meet the demands for optical properties, polymerization velocity, solubility, melting point, glass transition temperature, and the transparency, mechanical strength, surface hardness, heat resistance, and lightfastness of the polymer.",0.0,1134,US20180002276A1
" The polymerizable compounds included in the polymerizable composition are required to enhance physical properties of the polymerizable composition without degrading the other properties of the polymerizable composition.
",0.0,1355,US20180002276A1
There has been a demand for phase-retardation films having a small or reverse wavelength dispersion of birefringence in order to increase the viewing angles of liquid crystal displays.,0.0,1539,US20180002276A1
" Accordingly, various polymerizable liquid crystal compounds having a reverse- or small-wavelength dispersion have been developed as a material for such phase-retardation films.",0.0,1716,US20180002276A1
" However, when the polymerizable compounds are added to a polymerizable composition, the polymerizable compounds cause crystals to precipitate, that is, the polymerizable compounds degrade the preservation stability of the polymerizable composition (PTL 3).",0.0,1973,US20180002276A1
" Furthermore, when the polymerizable composition is applied to a base material and polymerization is subsequently performed, inconsistencies are likely to be formed in the resulting film (PTL 1 to PTL 3).",0.0,2177,US20180002276A1
" If the film having inconsistencies is used as a material for, for example, displays, nonuniformity in the brightness of the screen and unnatural colors may occur.",0.0,2340,US20180002276A1
 This significantly degrades the quality of displays.,0.0,2393,US20180002276A1

"HDAC proteins regulate the expression of several cancer-related proteins involved in cell signaling, transcription, and tumor suppression through the deacetylation of nucleosomal histone proteins.6-7 Overexpression of HDAC proteins results in unregulated transcription and aberrant protein activity and function, which is linked to several diseases, including cancer.7 For example, HDAC1 was overexpressed in lung,8 breast,9 and colon cancers.10 HDAC2 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer.11 HDAC8 was highly expressed in neuroblastoma patients, leading to cancer progression and poor survival rates.12 In addition, selective inhibition of HDAC8 induced apoptosis in leukemia and T-cell lymphoma cell lines.13 Class II HDAC6 was overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer.14-15 Overexpression of both HDAC6 and HDAC8 was linked to breast cancer metastasis and invasion.16

" Because trehalose and its derivatives, such as O-acylated derivatives (e.g., trehalose mono- and dimycolate) are integral to Mtb physiology and pathogenesis, yet absent from the human host, trehalose metabolism may be a target for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

"DETAILED DESCRIPTION
",0.0,2355,US20180072767A1
The present disclosure describes a class of trehalose analogues.,0.0,2419,US20180072767A1
 The analogues can be used for the detection and therapeutic targeting of mycobacteria.,0.0,2506,US20180072767A1
 Mycobacteria and other members of the Corynebacterineae have a unique cell envelope that is central to pathogenesis and provides intrinsic drug resistance (FIG.,0.0,2667,US20180072767A1
 1).,0.0,2671,US20180072767A1
" Mycobacteria have plasma membrane (PM) and peptidoglycan (PG) layers, wherein PG is covalently attached to the arabinogalactan (AG) layer, which in turn is covalently modified with long-chain (C60-C90) fatty acids called mycolic acids.",0.0,2907,US20180072767A1
" These AG-linked mycolates (AGM) are the foundation of the outer membrane, or mycomembrane (MM).",0.0,3003,US20180072767A1
" In addition to AGM, the MM includes other noncovalently associated lipids and glycolipids, most prominently virulence-associated trehalose dimycolate (TDM).
",0.0,3161,US20180072767A1
Biosynthesis of the MM is mediated by the disaccharide trehalose (FIG.,0.0,3231,US20180072767A1
 1).,0.0,3235,US20180072767A1
" In the cytoplasm, Pks13 links trehalose to mycolic acid to generate trehalose monomycolate (TMM), which, after translocation across the PM by MmpL3, acts as the mycolyl donor required for construction of the MM.",0.0,3447,US20180072767A1
" The antigen 85 complex (Ag85), consisting of several mycolyltransferases, is responsible for transferring mycolyl groups from the mycolyl donor TMM to either i) AG, leading to the formation of AGM, or ii) another molecule of TMM, generating TDM.",0.0,3693,US20180072767A1
" During these processes, trehalose is released and recycled by the transporter SugABC-LpqY.",0.0,3784,US20180072767A1
" The MM is essential to bacterial viability and many of its constituents are required for virulence in Mtb, so it presents a valuable target for TB diagnostic and drug development.
",0.0,3965,US20180072767A1
It is hypothesized that the disclosed analogues can take advantage of the aforementioned trehalose metabolism of mycobacteria (FIG.,0.0,4096,US20180072767A1
 31).,0.0,4101,US20180072767A1
" This affords the disclosed analogues to be covalently bound to the bacterium, which obviates specificity problems of known trehalose analogues that non-covalently modify bacterium.",0.0,4282,US20180072767A1
" In addition, mammals do not have enzymes that act on trehalose monomycolate, so the disclosed trehalose analogues may exhibit higher specificity for Mtb in the host environment compared to known trehalose analogues that have their detectable tag located directly on the trehalose disaccharide, which may be broken down in mammals via trehalose-cleaving enzymes called trehalases, or broken down by others types of microorganisms.
",0.0,4713,US20180072767A1
"Accordingly, the disclosed trehalose analogues can be advantageous for the detection and targeting of mycobacteria for both diagnostics and therapeutics.",0.0,4866,US20180072767A1
" Furthermore, the disclosed analogues have a broad flexibility in structure (due in part to the tolerance of the targeted biological machinery), which can permit the delivery of a very broad range of cargo to mycobacteria.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
",0.0,823,US20180092937A1
The role of the immune system is to protect the body from pathogens and malignant cells.,0.0,911,US20180092937A1
" However, viruses and cancer cells find ways to evade the immune system.",0.0,983,US20180092937A1
" The aim of immunotherapies is thus to initiate an antigen specific immune response or to re-activate a pre-existing response in certain cell types of the immune system against the pathogenic invaders or cancerous cells.
",0.0,1204,US20180092937A1
"The immune system consists of several specialized lineages which can be roughly grouped into two arms, the innate and the adaptive immune system.",0.0,1349,US20180092937A1
 For a successful immune reaction lineages from both arms have to act in concert.,0.0,1430,US20180092937A1
" A major role of the innate immune system is to mount a rapid immune response against pathogens or malignant cells which, unlike the adaptive system, is not antigen specific and long lasting.",0.0,1621,US20180092937A1
" In addition to the direct killing of pathogens or transformed cells, the innate immune system also activates and subsequently directs the adaptive immune system.",0.0,1783,US20180092937A1
 Antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells capture and present antigens in the form of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complex to T cells in lymphoid tissues.,0.0,1965,US20180092937A1
 This antigen presentation together with the secretion of certain cytokines leads to the activation and differentiation of antigen specific effector CD4 and CD8 T cells.,0.0,2134,US20180092937A1
" Type I interferon (IFN) production by antigen presenting cells, and other cell types, is considered a key event in the activation of T cells as the lack of type I IFN resulted in a reduced T cell dependent immune response against viral infections or tumor cells (Zitvogel et al, Nature Reviews Immunology 15, 405-414, 2015).",0.0,2459,US20180092937A1
" On the other hand, the presence of a type I IFN signature during cancer therapy is associated with increased numbers of tumor infiltrating T cells and potentially favorable clinical outcome (Sistigu et al, Nature Medicine 20, 1301-1309, 2014).
",0.0,2704,US20180092937A1
"Recent studies in mice have shown that efficient secretion of type I IFN in the tumor microenvironment and the induction of a T cell dependent immune response against cancer cells depends on the presence of the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as Tmem173, MPYS, MITA, ERIS)(Woo et al, Immunity 41, 5, 830-842, 2014; Corrales et al, Cell Reports 11, 1018-1030, 2015; Deng et al, Immunity 41, 5, 843-852, 2014).",0.0,3146,US20180092937A1
 The importance of the presence of type I IFN was highlighted by the fact that the deletion of STING resulted in reduced type I IFN levels in the tumor microenvironment and in a reduced anti-tumor effect in several tumor mouse models.,0.0,3380,US20180092937A1
" On the other hand, the specific activation of STING resulted in an improved, antigen specific T cell immune response against cancer cells.
",0.0,3520,US20180092937A1
STING belongs to the family of nucleic acid sensors and is the adaptor for cytosolic DNA signaling.,0.0,3619,US20180092937A1

" Binding of CDNs to STING induces conformational changes which allows the binding and activation of the TANK binding kinase (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the relocalisation from the ER to perinuclear endosomes (Liu et al, Science 347, Issue 6227, 2630-1-2630-14, 2015).",0.0,4214,US20180092937A1

Platinum(II) compounds as exemplified by cisplatin and its derivatives have been widely used in the treatment of cancer.,0.0,7401,US20200048291A1
"[1,2] Their mechanism of action is mainly through covalent crosslinking onto DNA, leading to cancer cell apoptosis or cell cycle arrest.",0.0,7537,US20200048291A1
"[3,4] Since DNA is the primary molecular target, cancer cells with changes in repair of DNA lesion, such as enhanced nucleotide excision repair or deficiency in mismatch repair, are found to show resistance to these platinum drugs.",0.0,7768,US20200048291A1
"[5] Moreover, these platinum drugs generally give rise to severe toxic side effects, probably due to the fact that DNA is not a specific biomolecule in cancer cells.",0.0,7933,US20200048291A1

It should be advantageous for developing anticancer drugs to target tumor microenvironment.,0.0,8128,US20200048291A1
" Tumor microenvironment is complex and dynamic, and is regulated by a number of mediators and signaling transduction pathways that govern tumor progression including tumor initiation, growth, angiogenesis and metastasis.",0.0,8348,US20200048291A1
"[6,7] For example, tumor cells developing their microenvironment by secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or cytokines to promote abnormal tumor neovasculature formation, which provides nutrients for further tumor growth and metastasis.",0.0,8601,US20200048291A1
"[8,9] In addition, binding of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) to uPA receptor (uPAR) in tumor microenvironment can trigger activation of metalloproteinases (MMPs) to degrade the components of surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM),[10] and hence contributes to tumor cell metastasis.",0.0,8890,US20200048291A1
" Together with the fact that over 90% of cancer deaths today are due to metastasis formation,[11] regulations of tumor microenvironment including inhibition of tumor growth, metastasis and VEGF-induced angiogenesis, have been considered as effective means in combating tumor progression.",0.0,9177,US20200048291A1

"A silane coupling agent is a compound that has in one molecule a part having reactivity to an inorganic substance (a hydrolyzable group bonded to a Si atom) and a part capable of performing the impartment of various functions such as reactivity to an organic substance, solubility, and weather resistance, and acts as an adhesive auxiliary at the interface between an inorganic substance and an organic substance, or a resin modifier for an inorganic-organic composite material, and therefore, the silane coupling agent is widely used as a composite resin modifier.

"On the other hand, a resin material has a problem of the time degradation due to action of light such as ultraviolet rays.",0.0,1150,US20200270285A1

",0.0,1403,US20200270285A1
"As a countermeasure against the above time degradation, it has been studied that together with an ultraviolet absorbing agent such as benzotriazole or benzophenone, a stabilizer such as a nickel complex, and an antioxidant such as a hindered phenol-based antioxidant, in particular, 2,6-bis(tert-butyl)-hydroxytoluene, a hindered amine-based light stabilizer that is known to exert an excellent effect in the impartment of light stabilization, particularly of weather resistance is mixed with a resin material.
",0.0,1914,US20200270285A1
"This hindered amine-based light stabilizer (HALS) suppresses the time degradation due to action of light such as ultraviolet rays on a resin, in particular, an organic resin, and has been widely used as a resin modifier capable of imparting weather resistance or light resistance to an organic resin.",0.0,2214,US20200270285A1

",0.0,2420,US20200270285A1
"However, in recent years, the weather resistance properties required for a resin material have become stricter, and there becomes a problem that the stabilization effect is not sufficiently maintained due to the surface contamination of a resin material by volatilization or bleed-bloom phenomenon of a hindered amine-based light stabilizer during long-term use, or due to the falling of a light stabilizer added along with the surface contamination.
",0.0,2871,US20200270285A1
"In order to solve the problem as described above, Patent Document 1 has disclosed a method for binding a hindered amine-based light stabilizer directly to a resin material or a polymer compound, and Patent Document 2 has disclosed a method for increasing the molecular weight by binding multiple hindered amine-based light stabilizers in one molecule.

"The hydrolyzable silyl group-introduced hindered amine-based light stabilizer of Patent Document 3 reacts and integrates with a resin, and therefore, can suppress the bleed-bloom phenomenon of the light stabilizer as compared with an existing hindered amine-based light stabilizer, however since the compatibility with a resin material is extremely high, it has been difficult to suppress the ultraviolet degradation on a surface of a resin material.

"Further, in the silicone polymer in which a hindered amino group is contained, due to the production method, an alkoxysilyl group having the highest reactivity with a resin material is preferentially consumed in dealcoholization condensation reaction, and therefore, there has been a problem that the ability to fix to a resin material is low, and the bleed-bloom phenomenon is easily generated.
