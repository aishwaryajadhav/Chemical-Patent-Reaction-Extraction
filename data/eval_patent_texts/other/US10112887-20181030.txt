INTRODUCTION
Reduction of polar C═X (X═O, N) bonds is one of the most fundamental organic reactions and is useful for the synthesis of a variety of organic alcohols and amines. Reduction of esters and imines is typically accomplished using main-group hydride reagents, such as LiAlH 4 , or using molecular hydrogen. The use of the hydride reducing reagents is inconvenient and expensive, particularly on a large scale; furthermore, this approach generates large amounts of chemical waste. The hydride reduction method can be dangerously exothermic at the stage of quenching and it can be difficult to control. The catalytic reduction of esters under hydrogen gas is, in all respects, a very attractive ‘green’ alternative to the classical hydride reduction.
A key component of the ester reduction with molecular hydrogen is the catalytic system utilized in the process. The catalyst system should ideally be able to rapidly bind and split molecular hydrogen to give a transition-metal hydride. The development of highly efficient and useful catalysts and catalytic systems for hydrogenation of lactones, esters, oils, and fats is an important need in chemistry. Particularly, developing hydrogenation processes operating in the temperature range of 20 to 100° C. and using less than 500 ppm (0.05 mol %) catalyst under relatively low H 2 pressure (1-50 bar) is highly desirable. Among the few catalysts and catalytic systems capable of converting esters and lactones into alcohols and diols under hydrogen gas, the ones that are presently most useful and efficient are complexes of ruthenium with bidentate phosphine-amine and tetradentate phosphine-imine ligands (described in Publication No. US 2010/0280273 A1, WO 2012/052996 A2, and in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 7473). The ruthenium catalyst loadings of 500-1000 ppm (0.05-0.1 mol %) could be used in this previous system, however, the system has a few major drawbacks, including relatively poor efficiency (low turnover numbers even at 100-110° C.) and often the need for a large (5-10 mol %) amount of base, such as NaOMe, thereby reducing the product selectivity and generating large amounts of chemical waste from product neutralization and extensive purification.
The development of green chemical processes and the use of biomass for hydrogen production have attracted much attention in recent years. Furthermore, acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of primary alcohols is an interesting transformation which leads to esters, imines, amines, or amides. Oxidant-free, catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols is of great importance for the chemical industry. A significant advance in dehydrogenation of bio-alcohols (chiefly ethanol) has been achieved with heterogeneous catalysts, however, at the cost of using harsh reaction conditions: high temperature (>200° C.) and pressure. Therefore, designing well-defined homogeneous catalysts for alcohol dehydrogenation under mild conditions represents an important scientific and practical goal. There has been little progress in the area of acceptorless dehydrogenation of primary alcohols since Cole-Hamilton and co-workers demonstrated dehydrogenation of ethanol catalyzed by [RuH 2 (N 2 )(PPh 3 ) 3 ], where an excess of NaOH, high temperature (150° C.), and an intense light source were needed to achieve TOF=210 h −1 , after 2 h (D. Morton, D. J. Cole-Hamilton, I. D. Utuk, M. Paneque-Sosa, M. Lopez-Poveda, J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1989, 489; D. Morton, D. Cole-Hamilton, J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1988, 1154; and D. Morton, D. J. Cole-Hamilton, J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1987, 248). In the recent years, several new homogeneous catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of primary alcohols have been developed and studied, such as the systems published by Milstein and co-workers (for a review see: D. Milstein, Top. Catal. 2010, 53, 915) and Beller ( Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 5711). However, most of these catalysts, with the exception of Ru-MACHO, are inactive at temperatures below 100° C., for example, for converting ethanol and propanol to hydrogen and ethyl acetate and propyl propionate, respectively.
Therefore, there remains a need for efficient and practical metal catalysts for the hydrogenation of esters, lactones, and fats and oils derived from natural sources, which can operate under base-free conditions and require relatively low reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure. There also remains a need for practical catalysts capable of efficient alcohol dehydrogenation under mild, and preferably neutral, reaction conditions, for environmentally benign production of esters and lactones from alcohols and diols, accompanied by formation of hydrogen gas.

According to one embodiment of the invention, the catalyst or pre-catalyst is a metal complex of the general Formulae II-III: in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"? M(SN) p Z a II in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"? in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?

The catalysts and pre-catalysts can exist in both neutral and cationic forms. The transition metal M is preferably a metal from groups 7 (manganese group), 8 (iron group), and 9 (cobalt group), in which Ru and Os are particularly preferable.
In one embodiment, the catalyst has the following structure:
or the corresponding complex in with the Ru is replaced with Os.
In one embodiment, the complexes of Formulae II-III can be prepared by reaction of the ligands of Formulae IA, or IB with a metal precursor, such as those well known in the state of the art. Preferably, the metal precursor is a ruthenium or osmium compound, including, for example, a compound of the following formulae: RuCl 2 (AsPh 3 ) 3 , RuHCl(AsPh 3 ) 3 , RuCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 3 , RuHCl(PPh 3 ) 3 , RuCl 2 (CO)(PPh 3 ) 3 , RuCl 2 (CO)(AsPh 3 ) 3 , RuHCl(CO)(AsPh 3 ) 3 , OsHCl(AsPh 3 ) 3 , OsCl 2 (AsPh 3 ) 3 , OsHCl(PPh 3 ) 3 , OsCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 3 , [RuCl 2 (p-cymene)] 2 , [OsCl 2 (p-cymene)] 2 , RuCl 2 (CO)(p-cymene), OsCl 2 (CO)(p-cymene), RuCl 2 (CO)(DMF)(PPh 3 ) 2 , [IrCl(COD)] 2 , [IrCl(COE) 2 ] 2 , IrHCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 3 , IrH 2 Cl(PPh 3 ) 3 , IrHCl 2 (AsPh 3 ) 3 , or IrH 2 Cl(AsPh 3 ) 3 . The reactions can be conducted in various organic solvents, such as, but not limited to, toluene, xylene, benzene, diglyme, DMF or DME.
Hydrogenation Process
The present application additionally provides a catalytic hydrogenation process. The catalyst complexes of Formulae II-III described above, have been shown to have high reactivity in reduction of the polar C═X (X═N, O) bonds. For examples, esters, ketones, fats, esters with multiple ester groups and imines can be mentioned.
In one embodiment, there is provided a process for hydrogenation of esters using metal catalysts based on the SNS ligand of Formula IB. The ester substrates are compounds of the following formulae:
The term “substrate”, as used herein, and as commonly understood by those of skill in the art, refers to the reactant that will be converted to a product during a catalytic reaction. Groups G1 and G2, simultaneously or independently, represent a linear, branched C 1 -C 40 or cyclic C 3 -C 40 alkyl, alkenyl or aromatic group, optionally substituted. Also contemplated herein is a situation when G1 and G2 together form a C 4 -C 40 saturated or unsaturated radical. The substrate of the hydrogenation reaction can be any organic compound containing one, or more than one, carboalkoxy group or C═X (X═O, N) bond. In this respect, natural fats such as olive, canola, corn, peanut, palm and other plant oils are useful substrates that can be reduced to form a mixture of alcohols. Imines can be reduced to amines and ketones to secondary alcohols.
The reduction reaction proceeds, generally, according to the reaction scheme below:
When the substrate is a monoester or a lactone, the products are alcohols or a diol, respectively. The naturally occurring triglycerides, oils and fats, can be reduced to glycerol and the corresponding fatty alcohols. Substrates with multiple ester groups, like phthalates, are reduced to diols and polyols. When the substrates are imines or ketones, the products are secondary amines and alcohols, respectively.
According to one embodiment, the process of catalytic reduction of imines and esters implies the usage of at least one of the metal complexes II or III, hydrogen pressure, and optionally a base and a solvent. The base may be necessary in those cases when the metal catalyst III contains one or more halogen atoms bonded to the metal. The treatment with base can be done prior to the reduction or in situ by adding base to the reaction mixture during hydrogenation. The catalysts and pre-catalysts of this invention can be used in a wide range of concentrations, preferably between about 10 and about 1000 ppm, and the loadings of 500 ppm or less are particularly preferred. The preferred amount of the catalyst will depend, as it is known to the person skilled in the art, on the type of the substrate, and increasing the catalyst loading may result in faster hydrogenation. The temperature at which the hydrogenation can be carried out is between about 0° C. and about 150° C., more preferably in the range between about 20° C. and about 100° C. and, as it is known to the person skilled in the art, the reaction rate will increase with an increase of the reaction temperature. The hydrogenation reaction requires a pressure of H 2 gas and should be performed in a suitable pressure vessel. The surface area of the reactor as well as the hydrogen pressure, as it is known to the person skilled in the art, can greatly influence the reaction rate. The greater the hydrogen pressure and/or the surface area of the reactor, the faster the hydrogenation reaction rate. In one embodiment the hydrogen pressure is in range of about 5 to about 200 Bar. Again, the person skilled in the art is well able to adjust the pressure as a function of the catalyst load and of the dilution of the substrate in the solvent. Examples of typical pressures used in the present hydrogenation reactions are from about 5 to about 50 bar (5 to 50×10 5 Pa).
It should be well understood, however, that the catalyst complexes described herein are also useful in catalyzing hydrogenation of substrates including functional groups other than esters and imines. The table below provides a non-limiting list of substrates and products that can be formed from a catalytic hydrogenation reaction using a catalyst of Formula II or III.
Dehydrogenation Reaction
The present application further provides a process of catalytic dehydrogenation using the catalyst complexes of Formulae II and III. For example, these catalysts or pre-catalysts are suitable for dehydrogenation of C n (n=2-200) alcohols possessing one or more —CH 2 OH groups thereby affording hydrogen gas and the corresponding esters or lactones. The substrates are compounds of the following formulae:
In this embodiment, R groups, simultaneously or independently, represent a linear, branched C 1 -C 40 or cyclic C 3 -C 40 alkyl, alkenyl or aromatic group, optionally substituted. Also contemplated herein is the situation when R is a C 4 -C 40 saturated or unsaturated cyclic radical. This implies that the substrate can be any organic compound containing one, or more than one, hydroxyl (OH) group.
The reduction process of this embodiment is illustrated below. When the substrate is an alcohol or a diol, the product is an ester or a lactone, respectively.
According to one embodiment, the process of catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation implies the usage of at least one of the metal complexes of Formulae II or III and (optionally) the use of a base and a solvent. The base may be necessary in those cases when the metal catalyst of Formula II or III contains one or more halogen or alkoxy (—OR) groups bonded to the metal. The catalyst can be treated with base prior to mixing with the substrate or in situ by adding base to the reaction mixture during dehydrogenation. The catalysts and pre-catalysts described herein can be used in a wide range of concentrations, preferably between about 10 and about 1000 ppm, and the loadings of 1000 ppm or less are particularly preferred. The preferred amount of the catalyst will depend, as it is known to the person skilled in the art, on the type of the substrate; and increasing the catalyst loading should result in faster dehydrogenation. The temperature at which the dehydrogenation can be carried out is between about 0° C. and about 200° C., more preferably in the range between about 50° C. and about 150° C. and, as it is known to the person skilled in the art, the reaction rate will increase with increase of the reaction temperature. The dehydrogenation process can generate a pressure of H 2 gas and, in such cases, can be performed in a suitable pressure vessel that is, if necessary, equipped with a pressure-release valve.
It should be well understood, however, that the catalyst complexes described herein are also useful in catalyzing dehydrogenation of substrates including functional groups other than alcohols. The table below provides a non-limiting list of substrates and products that can be formed from a catalytic dehydrogenation reaction using a catalyst of Formula II or III.
As noted above, a byproduct of the dehydrogenation reactions is H 2 . Accordingly, the present application further provides a process for producing H 2 . The process can conveniently make use of readily available substrates in a straightforward catalytic dehydrogenation process under relatively mild conditions to generate H 2 .
To gain a better understanding of the invention described herein, the following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only. Therefore, they should not limit the scope of this invention in any way.

The reaction was conducted for a predetermined length of time at 20-100° C. At the end of the reaction time, the reactor was placed into a cold water bath (if necessary) and it was depressurized after cooling to the ambient temperature.

After taking the stoppered flask out of the box, it was attached to a vacuum/Ar manifold. Under argon, the stopper was replaced by a finger condenser connected to a circulating refrigerated bath. When the temperature in the bath reached −10° C., the flask was placed in an oil bath preheated to 90° C. During dehydrogenation, the argon tank was kept closed and the H 2 gas produced passed through a mineral oil bubbler. The conversion to product was monitored by 1 H NMR spectroscopy.
Example 17. Catalytic Studies
An attractive “green” alternative to the classical methods for reduction of carboxylic esters is the catalytic hydrogenation shown in Scheme 1, a method which has attracted much recent interest for the reduction of esters under H 2 . [3-7]
The disclosure of Milstein's catalysts in 2006 (such as complex IV; Scheme 1)[3] was quickly followed by the development of the Firmenich catalysts in 2007,[4] among which [RuCl 2 (H 2 NC 2 H 4 PPh 2 ) 2 ] (II) is effective at 100° C. at a 0.05 mol % catalyst loading.[4a] In 2011, a new catalyst, Ru-MACHO (III), was patented by Takasago chemists.[5] Ru— MACHO is useful at a 0.05 mol % loading for the hydrogenation of methyl lactate and methyl menthoxyacetate, giving high yields of (R)-1,2-propanediol and 2-(1-menthoxy) ethanol, respectively. The most recent additions to this list of efficient catalysts are osmium and ruthenium complexes from the present inventors,[6] particularly the air-stable complex [RuCl 2 —(PPh 3 ){PyCH 2 NHC 2 H 4 PPh 2 }] (IV), which demonstrated unprecedented activity in the hydrogenation of esters and imines at [Ru] loadings as low as 50 ppm at 40° C.
It can be seen that all of the ester hydrogenation catalysts in Scheme 1 possess amino-phosphine ligands. More generally, many Noyori-type catalysts incorporate a combination of phosphorus and nitrogen donors.[8] Despite the widespread application and tremendous success of phosphines in catalysis, they have well-known disadvantages. Their preparations are often far from trivial and require handling under an inert atmosphere. As a result, the amino-phosphines are costly chemicals that can be challenging to make on a large scale. Not surprisingly, catalysts I-III (available from Strem Chemicals) are very expensive, especially I, which costs $680 per gram. Considering that ruthenium contributes less than 1% to this cost, it is apparent that the development of practical ester hydrogenation calls for using practical ligands, preferably ones containing no phosphorus.
In the present study, the catalytic activity of ruthenium complexes with the HN(C2H4SEt)2 (SNS) ligand was evaluated for ester hydrogenation. The SNS ligand was obtained nearly quantitatively by adding bis-(2-chloroethyl)amine hydrochloride to a solution of ethanethiol and NaOH in ethanol.[9b] This synthesis has the practical advantages of being straightforward and scalable; it can be conveniently performed in air, and it provides the SNS ligand at a small fraction of the cost of the amino-phosphines used in catalysts I-IV. The present application provides details of the preparation of an air-stable ruthenium-SNS complex that has now been found to be the most efficient catalyst for ester hydrogenation to date, outperforming the known catalytic systems I-III by a large margin. The significance of this finding goes beyond ester hydrogenation. It is now apparent that a new class of catalysts for the Noyori-type hydrogenation of compounds with C═X bonds can be made based on amino-sulfides that have the potential to replace the ubiquitous phosphorus-based ligands used in this area.
The ruthenium complexes shown below were obtained by the conventional ligand substitution reactions of HN—(C 2 H 4 SEt) 2 with [RuCl 2 (PPh 3 ) 3 ], [RuHCl(PPh 3 ) 3 ], [RuCl 2 (AsPh3)3], and [RuHCl(CO)(PPh 3 ) 3 ], as documented in the above Examples. Complexes 1 and 5 have been crystallographically characterized and their molecular geometries are presented in FIGS. 1 and 3 .[10]
The catalytic results of this Example are organized in Tables 3 and 4. First, the effectiveness of catalysts III-VII and present complexes 1, 3-5 were compared. Two typical substrates were selected for the comparative study: methylbenzoate and methyl hexanoate. The hydrogenations were performed at 40° C., under H 2 (50 bar), using a catalyst loading of 0.05 mol % in all cases. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy after 3 h of hydrogenation.
In all cases, they were found to contain the product alcohols together with varied amounts of byproduct from transesterification, as well as methanol and unreacted starting material. The results in Table 3 demonstrate that the Milstein and Takasago catalysts IV and V are the least effective in the group and produce little product under the test conditions. The Firmenich catalyst V shows a moderate performance, whereas complex VII is the most effective of the known systems. The new catalysts 1 and 3-5 are all active for esterhydrogenation; among these, the dichloride and hydrido-chloride complexes 1 and 3 give the best conversions to products, accompanied by formation of the smallest amounts of the symmetrical ester byproducts. To gain a broader understanding of the catalytic performance of complex 1, it was tested in the hydrogenation of the diverse group of substrates shown below, accompanied by variation of the reaction temperature, time, and substrate-to-catalyst (S/C) ratios.
Esters
Imines
Ketones and Aldehydes
Olefins
The data in Table 4 support the assessment of complex 1 as an outstanding hydrogenation catalyst possessing excellent efficiency and thermal stability and longevity in catalytic solutions. Large turnover numbers were observed for methyl and ethyl benzoates E1 and E2, respectively. For methyl hexanoate (E6), a high TON of 9800 is achieved in 2 h at 100° C. with 1, whereas Firmenich catalyst IV is known to be 6.5 times slower at this temperature for a similar substrate, methyl octanoate, giving a TON of 1880 after 2.5 h.[4a] The reduction of neat ethyl acetate (E5) is particularly impressive with 1, affording a TON of 58 400 after 21 h under very mild reaction conditions (T=40° C.). A relatively difficult substrate, methyl phthalate (E3) is also rapidly reduced with 1 (0.1 mol %) at 100° C.
Catalyst 1 was successfully tested for the hydrogenation of typical imines and ketones shown above, where TONs up to 40000 have been observed when running the reactions at 23-40° C. Catalyst 1 also has some activity for olefin hydrogenation. Styrene was reduced relatively rapidly at 40° C. with 1 (0.05 mol %). However, the reduction of 1-pentene was considerably slower, and 2-pentene was largely unchanged even after 48 h at 40° C. The latter observation is promising for the selective hydrogenation of esters, ketones, and imines containing internal C═C bonds. For example, the hydrogenation of methyl 3-nonenoate at 40° C. afforded trans-3-nonen-1-ol in a 73% yield. Such selectivity is rare among catalysts that are active for ester hydrogenation. So far, only one ruthenium catalyst from Firmenich[4] and an osmium catalyst from our group[6a] have shown good selectivity for the reduction of esters with internal C═C bonds.
As commented recently,[6b] high catalytic efficiency in ester hydrogenation is expected to correlate with activity in the reverse reaction of acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of alcohols, affording symmetrical esters. Indeed, when tested in the ADC reaction of ethanol under reflux, with S/C=2000 and 10 000, complex 1 gave 97% and 89% conversion to ethyl acetate in 16 and 24 h, respectively. This performance is similar to that of catalyst VII, and complexes 1 and VII are currently among the most efficient ADC catalysts.[11]
When studying the reactions of complex 1 upon heating in basic ethanol, a quantitative conversion of the dichloride into species 6 was observed, which was isolated and characterized as [RuH(OEt)(PPh 3 ){HN(C 2 H 4 SEt) 2 }] and crystallized with one equivalent of hydrogen-bonded ethanol, 6.EtOH ( FIG. 4 ). The preparation of 6 containing no ethanol was also possible by treating hydrido-chloride species 3 with EtONa in toluene. Interestingly, whereas 6 is thermally stable in solution, 6.EtOH is readily and selectively converted into [RuH 2 (PPh 3 ){HN(C 2 H 4 SEt) 2 }] (7) and ethyl acetate upon mild heating in toluene, as shown in Scheme 2.[12] The molecular structure of 7 is presented in FIG. 5 ; unlike the related mer-SNS compounds 1-6, the dihydride 7 adopts a fac-SNS geometry.
Scheme 2 has mechanistic implications, as the forward reaction is part of the ADC process, whereas the reverse reaction is ester hydrogenation. Complex 6.EtOH rapidly hydrogenates ethyl acetate at room temperature (23° C.), giving 77% conversion into ethanol within 1 h, under H 2 (50 bar), with [Ru] (0.02 mol %) and NaOEt (1 mol %) and with an efficiency corresponding to TOF=3850 h −1 . Without wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that dihydride 6 is the hydrogenation catalyst involved in this process, as well as in the reactions of Table 4, where 6 is presumably produced under H 2 from 1 and base. The NH group also appears to be important for catalysis. We synthesized two analogues of catalyst 1: [RuCl 2 (PPh 3 ){O(C 2 H 4 SEt) 2 }] (8) and [RuCl 2 (PPh 3 ){MeN(C 2 H 4 SEt) 2 }] (9), and these complexes proved to be inactive in the hydrogenation of methyl benzoate at 40-100° C., under the reaction conditions given in Table 3.
The mechanism of ester hydrogenation is poorly understood.[7i] According to Milstein et al[3a] and Saudan et al,[4a] the concerted transfer of a metal hydride and a ligand proton to the C═O group of the substrate first takes place, affording a hemiacetal intermediate. Dissociation of the hemiacetal gives rise to an aldehyde, which is hydrogenated again by the catalyst, thus completing the reduction process. In the present study, examination of the reaction mixtures by 1H NMR spectroscopy gave no evidence of the presumed hemiacetal oraldehyde intermediates of ester hydrogenation, ethanoldehydrogenation reactions, or the reaction shown in Scheme 2. It is likely that no free organic intermediate, hemiacetal or aldehyde, is released into the reaction solution during the reactions catalyzed by the SNS complexes presented herein.
A tentative mechanism for the base-free hydrogenation of ethyl acetate catalyzed by 6 is presented in Scheme 3. Free energies for all of the intermediates shown in Scheme 3 were calculated in ethyl acetate using the M06-L functional. Among the proposed key steps is the insertion of ethylacetate into a Ru—H bond of 7, to afford Int 1, which is analogous to the hemiacetaloxide formation in the reaction of trans-[RuH 2 {(R)-BINAP}{(R,R)-dpen}] with g-butyrolactone, as documented by Bergens et al.[7g] Inspection of the DFT-optimized structure of Int 1 revealed an interesting feature:Int 1 has a six-membered cycle formed by the H—N—Ru—OCH(Me)-OEt groups and closed by an NH—O hydrogen bond (d O-H =1.92 Å). The single C—O bond of Int 1 is elongated to 1.493 Å from the corresponding 1.345 Å distance in ethylacetate. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is conceivable that intramolecular nucleophilic substitution in step b results in the formation of bis(ethoxide) Int 2, which rearranges in step c to afford the dihydrogen complex Int 3. Heterolytic splitting of the η 2 -H 2 ligand in step d gives Int 4. Ethanol elimination accompanied by H 2 coordination and heterolysis in steps e and f regenerate dihydride 7. The isolated complex 6.EtOH (a mer-SNS isomer of Int 4) is apparently a resting state of the catalyst. Formation of 6 EtOH from 7, ethyl acetate, and H 2 is favorable by ΔG=−6.2 kcalmol −1 , which is 6.7 kcalmol −1 more stable than Int 4.
Base has a tremendous accelerating effect on the hydrogenation rate. Without base, 6.EtOH (0.02 mol %) gave only 4% conversion into ethyl acetate in 2 h at 40° C. under H 2 (50 bar), which corresponds to TOF=100 −1 vs. TOF=4100 h −1 with NaOEt (1 mol %) in 1 h under otherwise identical conditions. According to Bergens et al,[13] base helps by labilizing the alkoxide intermediates (such as Int 2 and Int 4) for EtO − substitution, through deprotonation of the NH group.
In conclusion, this Example demonstrates the successful use of embodiments of the present catalysts based on the HN(C 2 H 4 SEt) 2 ligand. The air-stable complex [RuCl 2 (PPh 3 ){HN—(C 2 H 4 SEt) 2 }] (1) shows outstanding efficiency for the hydrogenation of a broad range of substrates with C═X bonds (esters, ketones, imines) as well as for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of ethanol to ethyl acetate. This study has demonstrated that the phosphorus groups of Noyori-type catalysts can be successfully replaced by sulfide groups, thus overcoming the many drawbacks of working with phosphines and phosphine-based catalysts, such as high synthetic costs and the need for handling under inert atmosphere. Complex 1 is a practical and highly active green hydrogenation catalyst for substrates with C═X (X═O, N) bonds, and has a high potential to replace the use of main-group hydrides for the reduction of esters in the chemical industry and academic laboratories.

[10] The mer-SNS complexes form isomers in solution. This is due to the different arrangements of the SEt groups relative to the SNS ligand plane.

Experimental
In all cases, the catalytic reactions were studied by 1 H NMR spectroscopy using approximately 0.65 mL samples taken from the reactions mixtures without dilution or mixing with other solvents. The NMR spectra were collected without 2H lock, using 0.3 μs 1H pulses and a 10 s acquisition time to ensure accurate integration of the peaks. Examples of typical dehydrogenation and hydrogenation procedures are given below.
Hydrogenation Using Complex 1.
In an argon glovebox, the required amount of a 1.9 mg/g solution of 1 in THF was added to the desired amount of base (tBuOK, MeOK, or EtOK). The catalyst solution was further mixed with the substrate (0.02-0.20 mol) and transferred into a stainless-steel Parr reactor (75 mL or 300 mL) equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The reactor was closed, taken out of the glovebox, tightened and connected to a hydrogen tank. After purging the line, the reactor was pressurized to p(H 2 )=725 psi (50 Bar) and disconnected from the H 2 source (with the exception of reactions conducted in the 300 mL reactor using 0.2 mol of substrate). Then, the reactor was placed in an oil bath preheated to the desired temperature. At the end of the reaction time, the reactor was moved into a cold water bath for 5 min and depressurized.
Ethanol Dehydrogenation.
In an argon glovebox, a 50 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a stir bar was charged with the required amounts of the catalyst and EtONa. Then, 4.61 g (0.1 mol) or 9.21 g (0.2 mol) of ethanol was added. After taking the stoppered flask out of the box, it was attached to a vacuum/Ar manifold. Under argon, the stopper was replaced by a finger condenser connected to a circulating refrigerated bath. When the temperature in the bath reached −10° C., the flask was placed in an oil bath preheated to 90° C. During dehydrogenation, the argon tank was kept closed and the H 2 gas produced passed through a mineral oil bubbler.
Crystal Structure Determination.
Single crystals of complexes 1 and 5 were grown by slow diffusion of hexanes into their saturated solutions in dichloromethane. Single crystals of complexes 6 and 7 were grown by slow diffusion of hexanes into their saturated solutions in toluene. The crystallographic data for complexes 1, 5, 6, and 7 were collected on a BrukerAPEX II QUAZAR equipped with the IμS™ X-ray Source generator, a Kappa Nonius goniometer and a Platinum 135 detector. Cell refinement and data reduction were done using SAINT. [SAINT (1999) Release 6.06; Integration Software for Single Crystal Data. Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, Wis., USA] An empirical absorption correction, based on the multiple measurements of equivalent reflections, was applied using the program SADABS. [Sheldrick, G. M. (1999). SADABS, Bruker Area Detector Absorption Corrections. Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, Wis., USA] The space group was confirmed by XPREP routine [XPREP (1997) Release 5.10; X-ray data Preparation and Reciprocal space Exploration Program. Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, Wis., USA] of SHELXTL. [SHELXTL (1997) Release 5.10; The Complete Software Package for Single Crystal Structure Determination. Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, Wis., USA] The structures were solved by direct-methods and refined by full-matrix least squares and difference Fourier techniques with SHELX-97 [(a) Sheldrick, G. M. (1997). SHELXS97, Program for the Solution of Crystal Structures. Univ. of Gottingen, Germany. (b) Sheldrick, G. M. (1997). SHELXL97, Program for the Refinement of Crystal Structures. University of Gottingen, Germany.] as a part of LinXTL [LinXTL is a local program and it can be obtained free of charge from http://sourceforge.net/projects/linxtl/] tool box. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Hydrogen atoms were set in calculated positions and refined as riding atoms with a common thermal parameter, except those of the NH, OH moieties and hydrides, which were positioned from residual peaks in the difference Fourier map. All publication materials (cif files validation and ORTEP drawings) were prepared using LinXTL and Platon [A. L. Spek, Acta Cryst. 2009, D65, 148-155] programs.
