RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application is a 35 U.S.C. § 371 filing of International Application No. PCT/EP2015/080259, filed Dec. 17, 2015, which claims priority to European Patent Application No. 14290398.8, filed Dec. 19, 2014, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to compositions, preferably compositions comprising a permanent polymer network with chemical crosslinks, said compositions being able to be hot-fashioned. The present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing these compositions, to articles comprising these compositions and to processes for reshaping/recycling and/or healing these articles.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Polymer materials are classically subdivided in two main classes, thermosets and thermoplastics, according to their thermal behavior. The first synthetic thermosets for practical applications were invented in 1907 by Leo Baekeland by the combination of formaldehyde and phenol. The resulting highly cross-linked network gave a rigid material that does not soften when heated, and due to its versatility it was also called “the material of a thousand uses” (D. Crespy, M. Bozonnet, M. Meier, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2008, 47, 3322). Today, thermosets are used for many demanding applications because of their dimensional stability, creep resistance, chemical resistance and stiffness. Because of their molecular architecture, thermosets cannot be reshaped, processed or recycled after full curing. In contrast, thermoplastics can flow upon heating enabling multiple and easy processing, such as extrusion (N. G. Gaylord, J. R. Van Wazer, Journal of Polymer Science 1961, 51, S77), as well as recycling in many cases (M. Biron, Thermoplastics and Thermoplastic Composites: Technical Information for Plastics Users , Elsevier Science, 2007). Designing polymer systems which would combine the benefits of traditional thermosets with the ‘plastic’ properties that facilitate processing is therefore a challenge that has recently attracted great interest.
A way to make the combination of these properties is offered by the introduction of exchangeable chemical bonds into a polymer network, leading to dynamic cross-links. These bonds should be able to rearrange themselves in a reversible manner, providing on a molecular level a mechanism for macroscopic flow without risking structural damage. Polymer networks containing such exchangeable bonds, also known as covalent adaptable networks or CAN's (a) C. J. Kloxin et al., Macromolecules 2010, 43, 2643; b) C. N. Bowman, C. J. Kloxin, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 4272; c) C. J. Kloxin, C. N. Bowman, Chem. Soc. Rev. 2013, 42), may be further classified into two groups: those relying on dissociative exchange reactions and those relying on associative exchange reactions (a) T. F. Scott, et al., Science 2005, 308, 1615; b) R. Nicolaÿ et al., Macromolecules 2010, 43, 4355; c) Y. Amamoto, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 1660).
The most common ‘dissociative’ group of CAN's relies on a simple reversible covalent bond formation between two groups attached to the polymer chains. By triggering the reversed bond forming step (bond dissociation) the material can achieve topology rearrangements (stress relaxation and flow) simply because of a decrease in connectivity during the temporary depolymerization, resulting in a strong and sudden viscosity drop. Such systems will always present a sol/gel transition and can thus be solubilized in the presence of solvent. A well-known example of a thermally triggered dissociative CAN relies on the well-known reversible Diels-Alder reaction between furans and maleimides (X. Chen, Science 2002, 295, 1698).
A less common type of CAN's makes use of associative bond exchanges between polymer chains, in which the cross-links between polymer chains are only broken once another bond to another (part of the) polymer chain has been formed. As a result, such systems can change their topology with no loss of connectivity during the dynamic reorganization process, making such networks effectively permanent and insoluble even at (very) high temperatures. Interestingly, as with all chemical reactions, the rate of this associative exchange increases with the temperature, leading to an Arrhenius-like viscosity dependence rather than a sudden and marked viscosity drop at the sol/gel transition. Thermally triggered associative CANs have been coined vitrimers, (M. Capelot et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 7664.) because of their unique combination of insolubility and gradual thermal viscosity behavior which makes these permanent polymer networks processable just like glass.
In 2011, Leibler and co-workers introduced and demonstrated the unique properties of vitrimer materials using simple transesterification chemistry in an epoxy-based resin, cross-linked with polycarboxylic acids. Addition of a mild Lewis acid catalyst like zinc acetate to these classical resins resulted in an insoluble material which combined great mechanical properties, like classical hard epoxy resins, with the ability to be reshaped and reprocessed after full curing (D. Montarnal et al., Science 2011, 334, 965; b) M. Capelot et al., ACS Macro Letters 2012, 1, 789).
Since then, several other systems have been explored as possible vitrimer materials. Altuna and co-workers were able to produce citric acid-based polyester networks capable of some stress-relaxation even in the absence of a catalyst (internally catalyzed by unreacted carboxylic acids) (F. I. Altuna, V. Pettarin, R. Williams, Green Chemistry 2013).
Other polyester network and catalyst combinations have also been explored. (J. P. Brutman et al., ACS Macro Letters 2014, 607). Vitrimer(-like) materials have also been reported based on olefin or disulphide methathesis reactions (Y.-X. Lu, Z. Guan, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 14226; Y.-X. Lu, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 8424; A. Rekondo, et al., Materials Horizons 2013; Z. Q. Lei, et al., Chem. Mater. 2014, 26, 2038).
Although different chemistries for vitrimer materials have been explored, the reported materials all have relatively low Tg's (<57° C.) and their mechanical properties are often not comparable to those of commercial resins.
There is therefore a need to develop materials having the property of being able to be heated to temperatures such that they become fashionable without suffering destruction or degradation of their structure.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In an embodiment, the application of energy for hardening the article in optional step c) of the process may consist, in a known manner, of heating at a temperature ranging from 30 to 250° C. The optional cooling of the hardened article is usually performed by leaving the article to return to room temperature, with or without use of a cooling means.
For the purposes of the present invention, the term “article” means a component based on a material comprising a composition or the compound according to the invention.
It may also be an article made of composite material, a coating, a terminal, a bead or a film of adhesive. It may especially be envisaged to introduce before, during or after step a) one or more additional components that may be chosen especially from polymers, pigments, dyes, fillers, plasticizers, fibers, flame retardants, antioxidants, lubricants, wood, glass and metals.
In some embodiments, in the article according to the invention, the composition has reached or exceeded the gel point.
The articles according to the invention may also be coatings that are deposited on a support, for instance a protective layer or a paint. They may also be an adhesive material.
An article resulting from the forming and hardening of the composition described above also forms part of the invention.
In an embodiment, an article based on the present composition can be manufactured by mixing the components of the composition, introduction in a mould and raising the temperature. The means for manufacturing such an article are well known to those skilled in the art.
Other methods for forming the article than moulding may be envisaged, such as filament winding, continuous moulding or film-insert moulding, infusion, pultrusion, RTM (resin transfer moulding), RIM (reaction-injection moulding), 3D printing, or any other method known to those skilled in the art.
The materials based on the composition of the invention, on account of their particular composition, can be transformed, repaired and recycled by raising the temperature of the article. Below the Tg temperature, the polymer is vitreous and has the behavior of a rigid solid body.
The materials resulting from the hardening of the composition of the invention described above constitute another object of the invention.
The present invention also encompasses a process for transforming at least one article made from a material as described above, this process comprising: the application to the article of a mechanical constraint at a temperature (T) above room temperature.
Preferably, in order to enable transformation within a time that is compatible with industrial application of the process, the process comprises the application to the article of a mechanical constraint at a temperature (T) above the glass transition temperature Tg of the material of which the article is composed.
Usually, such a process is followed by a step of cooling to room temperature, optionally with application of at least one mechanical constraint.
For the purposes of the present invention, the term “mechanical constraint” means the application of a mechanical force, locally or to all or part of the article, this mechanical force tending towards forming or deforming the article. Among the mechanical constraints that may be used, mention may be made of: pressure, moulding, blending, extrusion, blow-moulding, injection-moulding, stamping, twisting, flexing, pulling and shearing.
It may be, for example, twisting applied to a strip of material of the invention. It may be a pressure applied by means of a plate or a mould onto one or more faces of an article of the invention, stamping a pattern in a plate or sheet made of material of the invention. It may also be a pressure exerted in parallel onto two articles made of materials of the invention in contact with each other so as to bring about bonding of these articles. In the case where the article consists of granules of material of the invention, the mechanical constraint may consist of blending, for example in a blender or around an extruder screw. It may also consist of injection moulding or extrusion. The mechanical constraint may also comprise blow-moulding, which may be applied, for example, to a sheet of material of the invention. The mechanical constraint may also consist of a plurality of separate constraints, of identical or different nature, applied simultaneously or successively to all or part of the article or in a very localized manner.
This transformation may include mixing or agglomeration with one or more additional components chosen from: one or more polymers, pigments, dyes, fillers, plasticizers, fibers, flame retardants, antioxidants, lubricants.
In some embodiment, assembly, bonding and repair are particular cases of the transformation process described above.
This raising of the temperature of the article may be performed by any known means such as heating by conduction, convection, induction, spot heating, infrared, microwave or radiant heating. The means for bringing about an increase in temperature of the article in order to perform the processes of the invention comprise: an oven, a microwave oven, a heating resistance, a flame, an exothermic chemical reaction, a laser beam, a hot iron, a hot-air gun, an ultrasonication tank, a heating punch, etc.
An article made of material of the invention may also be recycled: either via direct treatment of the article: for example, the broken or damaged article is repaired by means of a transformation process as described above and may thus regain its prior working function or another function; or the article is reduced to particles by application of mechanical grinding, and the particles thus obtained may then be used in a process for manufacturing an article. In particular, according to this process, particles of material of the invention are simultaneously subjected to a raising of temperature and a mechanical constraint allowing them to be transformed into an article. The mechanical constraint that allows the transformation of particles into an article may, for example, comprise compression in a mould, blending or extrusion. This method thus makes it possible, by applying a sufficient temperature and an appropriate mechanical constraint, to mould articles from the material. In particular, it makes it possible to mold objects from the material based on composition which has reached or exceeded the gel point.
Another advantage of the invention is that it allows the manufacture of materials made of the present composition such as particles, granules, beads, rods, plates, sheets, films, strips, stems, tubes, etc. via any process known to those skilled in the art.
These elemental components may then be transformed under the combined action of heat and of a mechanical constraint into articles of the desired shape: for example, strips may, by stamping, be chopped into smaller pieces of chosen shape, sheets may be superposed and assembled by compression. These elemental components based on the present material, are easy to store, transport and handle. Specifically, the step for transforming the components according to the invention may be performed by the final user without chemical equipment (no toxicity or expiry date or VOC, and no weighing out of reagents).
The fields of application of these materials are all those of thermosetting resins: materials, high-end thermoplastic materials, and composites for motor vehicles, for aeronautical construction, electronics, sport, construction, furniture, foams, biomedical applications, printing and packaging.
The resins according to the invention can be worked without flowing under its own weight over a much broader range of temperatures, which makes it possible to apply varied transformation methods. These methods can be of the same nature as those used in the metal and glass fields.
The resins and the materials of the invention also make it possible, by applying a sufficient temperature and an appropriate mechanical constraint, to mould articles made of the composition. The resins and the materials of the invention also make it possible, by applying a sufficient temperature and using good contact of the components, to assemble components by welding so as to form a more complex article. The resins and the materials of the invention also make it possible, by applying a sufficient temperature and a mechanical constraint, to repair a crack or damage caused in a component formed from the material or in a coating based on the material.
The invention will now be illustrated by the following, non-limiting illustrations of particular embodiments of the invention.

At low conversions under these pseudo-first order conditions, a linear decay was observed. At higher conversions, the reaction evolved slowly to a chemical equilibrium, as the backward reaction becomes more important. An activation energy of (58±6) kJ mol−1 was calculated for the exchange reaction, using the initial slopes [S. K. Upadhyay, Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics , Vol. 256, Springer, 2006].
These low MW compounds were also used to verify the thermal stability of these groups under conditions that would mimic thermal treatment of a bulk material. Vinylogous urethane 3 survived a treatment with an excess of benzylamine in bulk after heating overnight at 150° C.
Example 2 Polymer Network Composition Synthesis
1,4-Bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane bisacetoacetate (CDM-AA)
1,4 Cyclohexane dimethanol (88.9 g, 0.61 mol) and tert-butyl acetoacetate (200 g, 1.26 mol) were dissolved in 120 mL of Xylene in a 1 L flask equipped with a still head and cooler. The mixture was heated for 90 minutes at 135° C. The tert-butanol product was removed by distillation during the reaction and the temperature in the still head was typically between 75 and 90° C. When the temperature dropped to 50° C., the mixture was cooled and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The resulting crude product crystallized upon cooling with ice and consisted of a 28:72 mixture of the cis- and trans isomer as indicated by the singlets at 4.08 ppm for the cis-isomer and 3.97 ppm for the trans-isomer. Recrystallization of the crude product in isopropanol yielded 72% of white crystals which consisted of 92% of the trans-acetoacetate. Yield: 72%, 96.5 g. 1 H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl 3 , δ)=4.09 (d, J=7.19 Hz, 2H cis), 3.97 (d, 6.48 Hz, 2H trans), 3.47 (s, 2H), 2.28 (s, 3H), 1.83-1.78 (m, 4H), 1.68-1.62 (m, 2H), 1.05-1.01 (m, 4H).
CDM-AA 5, m-xylylene diamine 6 were used as monomers, with tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) 7 as a suitable trifunctional monomer to obtain networks.
Polymer 2: Xylylene diamine (2.111 g, 15.5 mmol), tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (1.774 g, 12.1 mmol) and CDM-AA (10 g, 32.0 mmol) were mixed in a vial and heated in a heated oil bath at 80° C. When a homogeneous liquid mixture was obtained, the mixture was taken out of the oil-bath while keeping mixing manually. After 2 minutes, the mixture turned white due to phase separation (water release of the condensation reaction). The resulting white paste was taken out of the vial and pressed into a film of 1.3 mm between two Teflon sheets using a pre-heated press at 90° C. After 30 minutes, the film was transferred into a convection oven and dried during 24 h at 90° C. minutes followed by a short post-cure of 30 min at 150° C.
ATR-FTIR confirmed the conversion of acetoacetates to polyvinylogous urethanes by the disappearance of the ester C═O and ketone C═O bands at 1724 and 1700 cm-1 and the appearance of the C═C and C═O bands of the polyvinylogous urethane at 1640 and 1604 cm-1 ( FIG. 3 ).
Three polymers with a constant theoretical gel point of 0.83 (Flory formula) and a stoichiometric ratio [R=(equivalent acetoacetate)/(equivalent amine)] of 1, 0.95 and 0.90 were prepared. The synthesis of polymer 2 is given above. Polymer 2 and 3 could be pressed after grinding into a homogeneous plate (30 min 150° C.).
The swelling ratio and the soluble fraction were determined for all three resins (Table 1).
Solubility tests were carried out with samples of a size of (10×10×1.3) mm 3 with a weight of around 170 mg and 25 mL of NMP as solvent. The samples were heated for 24 h at 100° C. Then, the solvent was removed in vacuo and replaced twice by MeOH to remove the NMP as much as possible. Finally, the samples were dried under vacuum, first overnight at 40° C. and then at 120° C. for 2 h to ensure a complete removal of the solvent from the material.
For the determination of the swelling ratio, the samples were swollen for 24 h at 100° C. in NMP as solvent. The solvent was removed and the resulting polymer gels were weighed. The swelling ratio was determined using: in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"? Swelling ratio=100%×( m swollen −m dry )/( m dry ) in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"? in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"? Swelling ratio= m swollen− m dry m in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?
As can be observed in Table 1, material with more free amines showed a higher swelling ratio, which can be attributed to the reorganization of the network. Without an excess of amines, very little amines were available for network reorganization.
The obtained networks showed significant swelling but did not dissolve in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), even when heated for 24 h at 100° C., well above the glass transition temperature of these materials (vide infra). Similar treatment, but with additional benzyl amine (equal mass as the polymer sample) in the solvent, resulted in complete dissolution due to the amine exchange reactions giving depolymerization.
The polymer 2 obtained with a stoichiometric ratio of 0.95 was chosen for characterization study (Example 3).
Example 3 Polymer Composition Characterization
Polymer 2 as prepared in Example 2 was further characterized: The bulk polymerization of CDM-AA, m-xylylene diamine and TREN yielded a glassy network at room temperature with excellent mechanical properties, evidenced by a glass transition temperature of about 87° C. ( FIG. 4 ), a storage modulus of ˜2.4 GPa ( FIG. 5 ) and stress at break of ˜90 MPa ( FIG. 6 ). Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) confirmed the presence of a network with a rubbery plateau of 10 MPa ( FIG. 5 ).
By thermogravimetic analysis (TGA), the vinylogous urethane networks proved to have good thermal stability with a mass loss of 2.5% at 287° C. (295° C. under nitrogen atmosphere) ( FIG. 7 ). Since the materials are expected to withstand elevated temperatures for longer periods when being processed, isothermal TGA was also conducted ( FIG. 8 ). The weight loss after 2 h at 150° C. and 180° C. was negligible (<0.5%) and comparable to that of a commercial epoxy (EPON 828 cured with DETA), indicating that the vinylogous urethane networks are stable when heated during a reasonable timeframe.
The flow properties of the vinylogous urethane polymer 2 prepared in Example 2 were studied by stress-relaxation and creep experiments. For the stress-relaxation, a torsional strain of 1% was applied and the relaxation modulus was monitored as a function of time. As shown in FIG. 9a , full stress-relaxation was observed at all temperatures. This behavior is in accordance with a viscoelastic fluid, further indicating that no non-exchangeable cross-links were introduced during the curing step or stress-relaxation experiment.
Based on the Maxwell model for viscoelastic fluids, relaxation times were determined at 37% (1/e) of the normalized relaxation modulus. These relaxation times range from 550 s at 130° C. to 85 s at 170° C. Taking into account the absence of catalyst and the rather rigid polymer structure, no other permanently cross-linked systems or vitrimers exhibit such a fast relaxation. This characteristic likely reflects the very high density of vinylogous urethanes in the network and the low activation energy for exchange (vide supra). Since the relaxation times are controlled by the associative exchange reactions, the temperature dependence of the relaxation time can be described by the Arrhenius equation [L. H. Sperling, Introduction to Physical Polymer Science , Wiley-Interscience, 2005.]

As shown in FIG. 9b , the relaxation times indeed followed the Arrhenius law, and an activation energy of (60±5) kJ mol-1 was calculated from the slope. This result is in very good agreement with the activation energy obtained for the compounds prepared in example 1.
In accordance with stress-relaxation experiments, creep experiments also confirmed that the vinylogous urethane polymer according to the invention behaves like a viscoelastic liquid at elevated temperatures. FIG. 10 depicts the results of elongational creep experiments at different temperatures. Following the initial elastic response, primary creep with a rapid rate decrease was observed. Then, a steady state was reached, characterized by a constant creep rate. When the stress was released, the material recovered only its initial elastic response and a permanent deformation remained. The networks were easily deformed up to 45% without rupture over a broad temperature range. These results clearly show that the vinylogous urethane polymers according to the invention can be processed without a precise control of the temperature, in strong contrast to the strict conditions required for processing of thermoplastics.
Recycling:
The recyclable nature of the networks was examined by first grinding the samples into fine particles which were used as raw substance for compression molding ( FIG. 11 ). To ensure the reversibility, the procedure was repeated four times and the recycled samples were subjected to tensile tests, DMA, DSC, solubility experiments, and ATR-FTIR for characterization. Tensile testing was performed on a Tinus-Olsen H10KT tensile tester equipped with a 100 N load cell, using flat dog bone type specimen with an effective gage length of 13 mm, a width of 2 mm, and a thickness of 1.3 mm. The samples were cut out using a Ray-Ran dog bone cutter. The tensile tests were run at a speed of 10 mm/min. Tensile tests revealed that the mechanical properties of the sample were fully recovered after being remoulded for 30 minutes at 150° C. ( FIG. 6 ). No change was observed in the Young's modulus and stress at break ( FIG. 12 ) while the strain at break ranged between 5.5 and 7.5% independently of the recycling cycle. In addition, DMA confirmed the recovery of the mechanical properties, as the observed rubbery plateau was constant within the experimental error (±5%), which indicates that no cross-links were formed nor broken ( FIG. 13 ). Since a slight shift in the maximum value of tan δ was observed, DSC was performed, and showed that the glass transition (Tg) at the second heating changed by less than 1° C. ( FIG. 14 ). In further agreement with DMA, solubility experiments showed that the soluble fraction varied from 7 to 14% without following a clear trend (Table 2), with the soluble fraction of the polymer as originally prepared being almost identical to that of the material recycled four times.
The lowest and highest values of three measurements are given.
Furthermore, no chemical degradation was visible on ATR-FTIR. The IR-spectra after subsequent cycles were almost identical ( FIG. 15 ). In general, the vinylogous urethane polymers exhibited excellent recycling properties over four recycling cycles without loss of mechanical properties or chemical changes.
The present inventors have developed new catalyst-free polymeric network having vitrimer like properties. The polymer of the invention possessed great mechanical properties and a Tg of 87° C. They behaved like classical networks evidenced by DMA and their insolubility. The vinylogous urethane networks were able to flow as shown by stress-relaxation and creep experiments. Moreover, they could be recycled without loss of mechanical properties.
The present inventors have therefore developed new compositions based on the transamination reactions of vinylogous urethanes. These compositions exhibited a Tg of 87° C., and displayed excellent mechanical properties such as a storage modulus of about 2.4 GPa. These compositions were insoluble even at elevated temperatures. Stress-relaxation and creep experiments showed a viscoelastic liquid behavior. Due to the fast exchange reactions and high density of exchangeable bonds throughout the network, relaxation times as short as 85 s at 170° C. were achieved without the use of any catalyst. These compositions could be recycled by grinding and remoulding the material several times without loss of mechanical properties. The compositions and material and articles made therefrom can be reworked to any shape while being at the same time permanently cross-linked.

Low Tg Vinylogous Urethane Network: Effect of the Presence of a Catalyst
The catalyst, Priamine 1074, Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN) and acetoacetylated pripol (PAA) were weighed in a vial in the given sequence (Table 6) resulting in a biphasic system, which was then manually mixed until a homogeneous mixture was obtained. The resulting mixture was poured on a Teflon sheet, manually spread to a thickness of around 1 mm and cured for 6 h at 90° C. yielding transparent, yellowish rubbery materials. These rubbers were cut in pieces and compression moulded for 30 minutes at 150° C. to defect-free samples of (40.0×70.0×1.3) mm 3 from which disk shape samples with a diameter of 26 mm were cut out. These disk-shaped samples were used for stress-relaxation experiments. The time measured to decrease a stress, which resulted from a controlled deformation, is measured over time and gives an indication of the processability of the material. The shorter the relaxation time, the faster the processing.
For Brondsted acids, equivalents were calculated versus the amount of free amines: pTsOH (10%): 0.0383 g, H 2 SO 4 (5%): 0.011 g
For The Lewis acids, amounts are calculated versus acetoacetate moieties: DBTL (2.5%, 1.2 m %): 0.267 g, DBTL (5%, 2.4 m %): 0.534 g
TBD was incorporated via swelling. Catalyst-free disk shape samples were swollen during 15 minutes in dichloromethane in which 14.6 mg/mL TBD was dissolved. The swollen samples were dried at 40° C. in vacuo overnight.
Stress-relaxation experiments were conducted on an Anton-Paar physica MRC 301 rheometer with a plate geometry of 25 mm and a strain of 5%. The time needed to decrease the initial stress, which resulted from the 5% deformation, to 1/e is given in table 7.
In accordance with the results obtained on low molecular weight model compounds (example 5), Bronstedt and Lewis acids decreased the relaxation times while a base increased the relaxation time.
