For example, a breaker may include: acids, such as mineral acids, for example hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, or hydrofluoric acid; bases, such as alkali metal hydroxides, for example sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, or ammonium hydroxide; enzymes, such as any enzyme capable of breaking a chemical bond comprised of a degradable unit; oxidizing agents, such as ammonium peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, degradation products of glucose or other sugars, or bleach; salts, such as salts containing alkali metal ions, such as sodium or potassium ions, for example sodium carbonate; alkaline earth metal ions, such as calcium or magnesium ions; ammonium ions; carbonate ions; hydrogen carbonate ions; phosphate ions; silicate ions; halogen ions, such as chloride or fluoride ions, for example sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or magnesium chloride; or minerals.
The term “breaker environment” is understood to mean a stimuli environment that causes a decrease in the viscosity of a mixture or solution either by making the conditions or local environment of the mixture or solution such that the star macromolecule or polymer has a reduced ability or is no longer able to thicken, and/or breaks or facilitates the breaking of chemical bonds, comprised of degradable units, contained within a star macromolecule or polymer, resulting in a decrease in viscosity of the mixture or solution.
The term “stimuli environment” is understood to include temperature (e.g., at high temperatures, for example, temperatures greater than 450° F., such as greater than 600° F., or greater than 800° F.; or at low temperatures, for example, less than −30° F., such as less than −50° F., or less than −50° F.), salinity (e.g., at high salt concentrations, for example, at greater than 3 wt. %, such as greater than 5 wt. %, greater than 10 wt. %, greater than 15 wt. %, greater than 20 wt. %, or greater than 25 wt. %), mechanical (e.g., at high shear rates), photo (either light or dark), or chemical (e.g., at high or low pH, or other chemical trigger).
In certain embodiments, the polymer composition, the number of polymeric arms on any particular star macromolecule varies across the population of star macromolecules in each composition, due to the synthetic process used for the synthesis of the composition. This process is called “arm first” method and is described in details herein below. Due to variation in the number of polymeric arms in star macromolecules, the number of polymeric arms, such as the number of polymeric arms r, s and/or t, are referred as an average number of polymeric arms. Monomer units within the polymeric arms or core of the star macromolecule of the present invention may be connected with C—C covalent bonds. In certain embodiments, the C—C covalent bonds may make it difficult to degrade such that the star macromolecule may perform as efficient thickening agent in a harsh environment, for example, a very high/low pH or in the presence of strong oxidizing agents.

Macroinitiator [(MMA) 20 -co-(SMA) 7 ] was synthesized by using Activators ReGenerated by Electron Transfer (ARGET) ATRP. The molar ratio of reagents used was: MMA/SMA/DEBMM/CuBr 2 /TPMA/Sn(EH) 2 =40/10/1/0.005/0.0175/0.05 in anisole (20% v/v). In a 250 mL round bottom flask, MMA (48 mL), SMA (38 g), and DEBMM (2.14 mL), were added to anisole (12 mL). A pre-mixed solution of CuBr 2 /TPMA (13.3 mg CuBr2/57 mg TPMA) in DMF (1.5 mL) was added to the flask, which was then sealed with a rubber septum, and purged with nitrogen for 1.0 hour. The flask was then placed in a 75° C. oil bath, and injected with Sn(EH) 2 (0.193 mL) to start the reaction. Samples were taken to monitor the monomer conversion. After 23 hours, the flask was opened to air and the reaction was stopped. The polymer was purified by precipitation into methanol. The molecular weight measured by GPC was 4461 g/mol and PDI was 1.12. Yield: 22 grams of polymer was obtained after purification.

In a 22 mL vial, CuBr 2 (19.05 mg) was dissolved in DMF (6.6 mL) with Me 6 TREN (0.1 mL) to make a stock solution. A 250 mL round bottom flask was charged with [(MMA) 20 -co-(SMA) 7 ] (1.52 g) from step 1, tBA (40 mL), and anisole (20 mL).

The reaction flask was heated up to 65° C., and the reaction was injected with 0.1 mL of the V-70/acetone solution every 20 minutes. Sample was taken for analysis and as the conversion of monomer reached 44%, 0.2 mL of EBiB was injected. After that, 0.1 mL of the V-70/acetone solution was injected every 30 minutes. As the monomer conversion reached 85%, the reaction flask was open to air.

A solution of CuBr 2 /TPMA (3.74 mg CuBr 2 /30 mg TPMA) in DMF (2.0 mL), DVB (4.28 mL), and anisole (28 mL) were added to the reaction flask, and the resulting polymer solution was purged with N 2 for 1 h, and then heated up to 95° C. To the reaction flask was injected Sn(EH) 2 (0.08 mL), to start the reaction. Sample was taken for analysis and 16 hours later as the conversion of DVB reached 77%, the heating was stopped and the flask was opened to air. Molecular weight of [((MMA) 20 -co-(SMA) 7 )-b-(tBA) 351 ]/[(tBA) 64 ] star molecule was determined by GPC. Mn=78817 g/mol, Mp=205801 g/mol, PDI=2.47. The GPC results were present in FIG. 1 . The deprotection was then conducted by adding formic acid (20 mL) and sulfuric acid (0.1 mL) to the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was heated up to 75° C. After 6 hours, the reaction was finished. The liquid was decanted and the solid polymer was washed with acetonitrile and acetone in the flask for 3 times.

The thickening property (influence on viscosity) and shear thinning property of aqueous solutions (water or surfactant-containing solutions) containing star macromolecules was investigated.
The viscosity of the aqueous solutions of the star macromolecules vs. shear rate was measured using a BROOKFIELD® LVDV-E Viscometer equipped with a Spindle LVDVE SC4-31 at T=25° C. (shear rate=rpm×0.34), or if the viscosity it too great for that spindle, then a Spindle LVDVE SC4-25 at T=25° C. (shear rate=rpm×0.22). The viscosity of the samples were measured at 25° C., unless otherwise specified. In general, the viscosity ranges (cP) suitable for the Spindle LVDVE SC4-31 is 3 cP to 100,000 cP, and the viscosity ranges (cP) suitable for the Spindle LVDVE SC4-25 is 800 cP to 1,600,000 cP. For samples with viscosities within the test range having a viscosity below 100, Spindle SC4-31 should be selected.

The water was stirred at 600 rpm to generate vortex, and to this was slowly sprinkled in a certain amount of the specified solid polymer. The resulting aqueous polymer solution was then heated to 30° C., and if necessary, adjusted to a pH of 7 (e.g., add solid NaOH), and the stirring rate was then increased to 800 rpm, and then to 1600 rpm. The aqueous polymer solution was stirred for 15-20 min until the temperature reached 80-90° C. The resulting mixture was then homogenized with a Silverson homogenizer equipped with a Square Hole workhead and Axial Flow workhead. The homogenizer stirring speed was gradually increased to 4800±200 rpm and mixed for 35 min. until a thick homogeneous gel was obtained. The pH of the resulting gel was analyzed with pH meter and, if necessary, adjusted to pH=7.0 (e.g., add solid NaOH).
