FIELD OF INVENTION
The present invention relates to a composition comprising a lignin polyol, a method for the manufacturing of said composition and use thereof in different application areas, such as in adhesives, binders, castings, foams (such as in rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams for thermal insulation and construction applications, semi-rigid, flexible, moulded, laminated, microcellular and viscoelastic polyurethane foams), fillers, glues, sealants, elastomers and rubbers.
The present invention also relates to a method for the manufacturing of a foam and use of this foam.
BACKGROUND
The interest in utilization of lignin in various applications has steadily grown over the years with the main driving force to find a sustainable alternative to mineral oil-based products. An area where the intrinsic properties of lignin i.e. the existence of a cross-linked network, can be harnessed most efficiently is the utilization of lignin to reinforce a multitude of polymeric materials such as urethane-based networks and polymers.
In DE 19,548,350, DE 19,648,724, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,918,167, 3,546,199, 3,654,194, WO 2013,113,462 as well as the set of publications by Glasser and co-workers [1-8] and more recently by Cateto et al. [9-10], Gandini et al. [11] Nadji et al. [12], Li et al. [13], Xue et al. [14], and Arshanitsa et al. [15, 16] alkoxylation of lignin has been attempted. However, these approaches so far encounter some serious drawbacks; 1) All scientific publications as well as all relevant patents report significant degrees of homopolymerization of propylene oxide under the reaction conditions applied [WO 2013,113,462]. As a consequence, the degree of process control for the polyol synthesis is severely reduced and the formulation latitude is more or less lost due to difficulties to assess how much homopolymer is formed.
2) At the reported reaction conditions, self-condensation of the lignin macromolecule structure is always present leaving non-soluble fractions in the resulting polyol [WO 2013,113,462]. This requires additional filtration step(s) in the polyol manufacturing process.
US 2,013,255,216 claims a modified lignin comprising phenolic groups masked with propylene oxide. However the claimed compositions are produced in aqueous environment which is severely limiting the application in the production of polymers, especially those polymers comprising water-reactive monomeric species such as urethanes.
In conclusion, none of the aforementioned publications and patents describes a satisfactory technology for producing lignin polyols.
A dispersion containing lignin is also disclosed in WO2013179251
Therefore there exists a need for a method to produce lignin polyols that are liquid, smell neutral, without homopolymers and/or precipates that require unwanted additional processing steps (such as filtration, extraction etc.).

EXAMPLES
Example 1
28.5 parts of Kraft lignin was dispersed in 80 parts PEG400 (polyethylene glycol with Mn 400 Da, obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) and 1.4 parts potassium hydroxide. The dispersion was heated under vacuum to 120-130° C. to remove excess water. After complete removal of water, the dispersion temperature was dropped to 40-50° C. 19 parts propylene oxide (obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) was added continuously to the dispersion and the reaction proceeded for 18 h.
After completion of the reaction, 1.5 parts glacial acetic acid (100%) was added in an equimolar amount to the potassium hydroxide. The mixture was heated to 100° C. and stirred for 1 h.
The lignin polyol was further characterized through isolation of the alkoxylated lignin and the dispersant as described below; 1. The alkoxylated lignin was precipitated (by addition of 2M HCl and deionized H2O) followed by filtration yielding a solid retentate consisting of the alkoxylated lignin and a liquid filtrate consisting of the dispersant and dionized H2O.
2. The filtrate was freeze-dried to remove excess water.
3. The isolated alkoxylated lignin was washed with deionized water until the washing liquid pH stabilized. It was subsequently freeze-dryed to remove all excess water. The isolated dispersant was dissolved in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 (depending on the solubility) and analyzed at room temperature on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. Quantitative 13C-NMR and 1H-NMR spectra were collected collected with inverse gated decoupling pulse sequence with 30° pulse angle, delay of 6 s and 2 k scans. The 31P-NMR spectra were acquired using inverse gated decoupling pulse sequence with 90° pulse angle, delay of 6 s and 256 scans.
Quantification of the degree of homopolymer formation and/or propylene oxide capping of the dispersant was conducted using the 13 C-NMR spectrum ( FIG. 2 ). By setting the integral area of the backbone carbons at 70 ppm to 14 (assuming 7 repeating methylene units in the PEG400 backbone), the integral area of the group peaks at 18 ppm is obtained. This peak is distinctive for the methyl group of the propylene oxide. Presence of this group indicates either that homopolymers are formed or that propylene oxide capping of terminal hydroxyls of the dispersing polyol has occurred. Assuming a full propylene oxide capping of the dispersant polyol, this integral area is expected to have value of 2 (one methyl group per hydroxyl group of PEG400). Dividing this integral area with 6 yields the percentage of dispersant capped by propylene oxide. The obtained value was 6.5%. The terminal methylene carbons assigned as “a” and “b” retain their shift and sum of area of close to 2 (as compared to the 13 C-spectrum of the pure dispersant, FIG. 1 ) indicating that capping has indeed occurred on the terminal hydroxyls.
The isolated alkoxylated lignin were further characterized through complete phosphitylation with 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane (TMDP) followed by 31 P-NMR analysis using endo-N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide (e-HNDI) as an internal standard to quantify the amount of phopsphitylated hydroxyls as described elsewhere [17]. The results are listed in.
Example 2
50 parts of Kraft lignin was dispersed in 70 parts diethylene glycol (obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) and 2.5 parts potassium hydroxide. The dispersion was heated under vacuum to 120-130° C. to remove excess water. After complete removal of water, the dispersion temperature was dropped to 40-50° C. 32.8 parts propylene oxide (obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) was added continuously to the dispersion and the reaction proceeded for 18 h.
After completion of the reaction, 2.6 parts glacial acetic acid (100%) was added in an equimolar amount to the potassium hydroxide. The mixture was heated to 100° C. and stirred for 1 h.
The dispersant and alkoxylated lignin were separated as described in Example 1 and further characterized individually by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR and 31 P-NMR as described in Example 1. 1 H-NMR analysis of the isolated dispersant showed no capping of the terminal hydroxyls ( FIGS. 3, 4 ).
Example 3
40 parts of Kraft lignin was dispersed in 70 parts tetraethylene glycol (obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) and 2 parts potassium hydroxide. The dispersion was heated under vacuum to 120-130° C. to remove excess water. After complete removal of water, the dispersion temperature was dropped to 40-50° C. 26.2 parts propylene oxide (obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) was added continuously to the dispersion and the reaction proceeded for 18 h.
After completion of the reaction, 2 parts glacial acetic acid (100%) was added in an equimolar amount to the potassium hydroxide. The mixture was heated to 100° C. and stirred for 1 h.
The dispersant and alkoxylated lignin were separated as described in Example 1 and further characterized individually by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR and 31 P-NMR as described in Example 1. The degree of conversion of the terminal hydroxyls on the dispersant polyol was calculated using the collected 1 H-NMR spectrum ( FIG. 5 ). Here, the integral area of the signals representing the backbone hydroxyls of tetraethylene glycol was set to 16 to obtain the integral area of the terminal methyl groups at 1.1-1 ppm. This group of peaks is characteristic for methyl protons indicating that either homopolymerisation on of propylene oxide has occurred or that capping of terminal hydroxyls of tetraethylene glycol by propylene oxide has occurred. Assuming full capping of the terminal hydroxyls of tetraethylene glycol, the theoretical value of this peak group is 6 (3 methyl protons per tetraethylene end group). Dividing the observed integral area signal of 0.36 with the theoretical value of 6 yields the degree of capping of terminal hydroxyls by propylene oxide. This value was 6% in this Example.
Example 4
22 parts of Kraft lignin was dispersed in 80 parts tetraethylene glycol and 1.1 parts potassium hydroxide. The dispersion was heated under vacuum to 120-130° C. to remove excess water. After complete removal of water, the dispersion temperature was dropped to 40-50° C. 7.2 parts propylene oxide (obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) was added continuously to the dispersion and the reaction proceeded for 18 h.
After completion of the reaction, 0.6 parts glacial acetic acid (100%) was added in an equimolar amount to the potassium hydroxide. The mixture was heated to 100° C. and stirred for 1 h.

The degree of conversion of phenolic to aliphatic hydroxyls in the isolated alkoxylated lignin was determined to 65% (Table 2).
Example 7
20 parts of Kraft lignin was dispersed in 55 parts PEG400 (polyethylene glycol with Mn 400 Da, obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) and 1.4 parts potassium hydroxide. The dispersion was heated under vacuum to 120-130° C. to remove excess water.

The dispersant and alkoxylated lignin were separated as described in Example 1 and further characterized individually by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR and 31 P NMR as described in Example 1. The degree of capping by propylene oxide of the terminal hydroxyls on the dispersant polyol and/or propylene oxide homopolymer was calculated from the obtained 13 C-NMR spectrum ( FIG. 7 ) to 4% as described in Example 1 (Table 1).
The degree of conversion of phenolic to aliphatic hydroxyls in the isolated alkoxylated lignin was determined to 53% (Table 2).
Example 8

The dispersion was heated under vacuum to 120-130° C. to remove excess water. After complete removal of water, the dispersion temperature was dropped to 40° C. 13 parts propylene oxide was added continuously to the dispersion and the reaction proceeded for 18 h.

The dispersant and alkoxylated lignin were separated as described in Example 1 and further characterized individually by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR and 31 P NMR as described in Example 1.
No conversion of terminal hydroxyls of the dispersant could be detected ( FIG. 8 ).
The degree of conversion of phenolic to aliphatic hydroxyls in the isolated alkoxylated lignin was determined to 93% (Table 1).
Example 9
20 parts of Kraft lignin was dispersed in 55 parts PEG400 (polyethylene glycol with Mn 400 Da, obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) and 1.4 parts potassium hydroxide. The dispersion was heated under vacuum to 120-130° C. to remove excess water. After complete removal of water, the dispersion temperature was dropped to 40° C. 17 parts 2,3-epoxy-1-propanol (obtained from Sigma-Aaldrich) was added continuously to the dispersion and the reaction proceeded for 18 h.
After completion of the reaction, 1.5 parts glacial acetic acid (100%) was added in an equimolar amount to the potassium hydroxide. The mixture was heated to 100° C. and stirred for 1 h.
The dispersant and alkoxylated lignin were separated as described in Example 1 and further characterized individually by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR and 31 P-NMR as described in Example 1. The degree of conversion of the terminal hydroxyls on the dispersant polyol was calculated as described below. Owing to the absence of a terminal methyl carbon in the glycidol structure, quantification of homopolymers presents a greater challenge as compared with the examples where propylene oxide was used.
To properly identify the relevant signal peaks corresponding to glycidol homopolymer and/terminal capped groups of the dispersant polyol, homopolymerization of pure glycidol initiated by H2O in the presence of KOH was performed. This reaction was performed at 40° C. overnight. The resulting homopolymer was isolated from the reaction mixture by removal of water through freeze-drying and analyzed with 13 C-NMR as described in Example 1. The 13 C-NMR spectrum of a glycidol homopolymer is presented in FIG. 9 . Here, a set of peaks at 60, 63, 67, 70 and 73 ppm has been identified to originate from backbone and terminal methylene units of the glycidol homopolymer ( FIG. 9 ). Of this set, the peak at 70 ppm is omitted from further quantification due to possible overlap with peaks from the dispersing polyol. The sum of the remaining peaks, setting the area of the peak at 60 ppm to 1 is 16. This number is used as the theoretical value of full conversion to glycidol homopolymer.
13 C-NMR spectrum of the isolated dispersant polyol PEG400 is presented in FIG. 10 . Quantification of homopolymer amount was done by obtaining the areas of the peaks at 60, 63, 67 and 73 ppm ( FIG. 10 ) setting the area of the signal representing the backbone methylene unit of the dispersant polyol to 14. Dividing the sum of these signals with 16 (the total area sum of corresponding peaks in the spectrum of pure glycidol homopolymer, FIG. 9 ) gives the yield of formed homopolymer. This value was calculated to 9.6%.
Capping of terminal hydroxyls of the dispersant polyol can in this instance be ruled out as it would result in a completely different spectrum with loss of terminal methylene carbon signals and the appearance of a tertiary carbon signal at 100 ppm and higher which was not observed in the collected spectrum.
The degree of conversion of phenolic to aliphatic hydroxyls in the isolated alkoxylated lignin was determined to 96% (Table 1).

Examples of Polyurethane Foams
The applicability of the invention is further demonstrated by Examples 14-38, comprising the preparation of polyurethane foams by handmix foaming (which thus was a discontinuous, batch-wise process). To this end, the compositions were prepared by weighing a target amount of lignin polyol from examples 1-11, followed by addition of all other polyol components and additives, except the blowing agent(s). The blowing agent was added last, using the Heidolph stirrer described below, just before mixing the polyol blend with Lupranate® M20S from BASF which was invariably used as PMDI. Handmix foams were prepared using a Heidolph lab. stirrer fitted with timer and rpm counter as follows. After preparing the polyol blends in a carboard beaker, a weighed amount of Lupranate® M20S was poured in the beaker. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred for 10 seconds at 4000 rpm, after which the reacting mass was poured into a 20×20×20 cm 3 cardboard box where it was allowed to rise freely and cure. Nucleation was recorded in the usual way by visually inspecting the transition to a creamy mass in the box (cream time). The fully developed foam was then probed by a disposable (wooden) spatula to check the formation of strings in the foaming mass. The first appearance of these strings was recorded as ‘string time’. Finally, the same spatula was used to test ‘tackiness’ of the fully risen foam. The first disappearance of tackiness was recorded as ‘tack free’ time. Polyurethane (PUR) foams were selected as the first target to demonstrate the capabilities of the invention which is however not limited to this particular application.
